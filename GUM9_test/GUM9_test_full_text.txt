The prevalence of discrimination across racial groups in contemporary America: Results from a nationally representative sample of adults IntroductionPersonal experiences of discrimination and bias have been the focus of much social science research. [1 - 3] Sociologists have explored the adverse consequences of discrimination [3 – 5]; psychologists have examined the mental processes that underpin conscious and unconscious biases [6]; neuroscientists have examined the neurobiological underpinnings of discrimination [7 – 9]; and evolutionary theorists have explored the various ways that in-group / out-group biases emerged across the history of our species. [10] In many respects, researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias. [11] What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practicesMandatory diversity trainings in professional settings, for example, are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members. [12] Indeed, the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are, at least to some appreciable amount, present in modern societyEven so, estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare (see [13 – 14])At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [15], however, using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample, reported that approximately 33% of respondents reported some form of discrimination (see also, Gibbons et al. [4])The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large, nationally representative sample of adults from the United StatesAdditionally, the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiencesReason for discriminationAll respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically, those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question: “What do you think was the main reason for these experiences?” Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categoriesFor the present analysis, these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories capturing the following options: race / ancestry / skin color; gender; age; religion; height or weight; sexual orientation; education or income; physical disability; and otherThe following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis: race; ancestry or national origin; and shade of skin colorAdditionally, because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences, the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing (legitimate skip)Respondent raceBecause a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews, we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interviewWave 1 race — rather than, say, Wave 3 race — was used to preserve case countsThe logic is that (nearly) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample, but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attritionRespondents were asked to indicate their race from among the following categories: White; Black or African American; Hispanic; American Indian or Native American; and Asian or Pacific IslanderRespondents were provided the opportunity to select more than one race, and those who did were asked a follow-up question regarding which category best described their racial backgroundIn the current study, those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as “mixed race”Demographic variablesTo provide information on the analytical sample as a whole, two additional demographic variables are includedFirst, age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents' birth (obtained from Wave 1) from the year of the interview at Wave 4Second, sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 (0 = female and 1 = male)Analytical planOur exploratory study included three basic stepsFirst, summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were producedSecond, we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial categoryFinally, we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categoriesIn order to examine potential bivariate associations, the adjusted F statistic (design-based F) was employed as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health. [21] More specifically, when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “an Fstatistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott (1981 [22], 1984 [23]) correction”. [24] The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate (than the associated with the χ2 statistic) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the dataThis final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discriminationAs noted earlier, all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategyThus, all estimates reported here can be considered nationally representative of the United States 
2. GUJJOLAAY EEGIMAA, ITS SPEAKERS AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS. This section briefly presents the Gújjolaay Eegimaa (Eegimaa for short; Ethnologue code: ISO 639-3: bqj), its speakers and its varietiesWe also discuss aspects of the contact situation of the Eegimaa languageThis is important, because as we will show in § 6 below, some of the Eegimaa death prevention names and child-bearing names are given to Eegimaa people from other communitiesEegimaa is a Jóola language spoken in the Basse Casamance area of Southern Senegal by a population estimated to be between 7,000 (Bassène, 2007) and 11,200 speakers (Lewis, Simons, & Fennig, 2014)Jóola languages are classified as members of Sapir’s (1971) BAK group of Atlantic languages of the Niger Congo language phylumSpeakers of these languages are found in the Gambia, in the former Casamance region of Southern Senegal and in Guinea BissauThe map in Figure 1, taken from Ethnologue, presents the languages of SenegalThe arrow on the map points to the Eegimaa speaking area (Bandial is the name used by Ethnologue for Eegimaa)Eegimaa is mainly spoken in Mof-Ávvi, a former kingdom of 10 villages located to the west of Ziguinchor, the capital city of the former administrative region of Casamance in the south of SenegalMof-Ávvi is a peninsula bordered by the Casamance River to the north, which separates it from the Jóola Búluf and Jóola Fogny areas, and to the east by the villages Brin and Djibonker, where the speakers of Kujireray and Baïnounk Gubëeher liveIn the south, the river known as Kamobeul Bolon separates Mof-Ávvi from the Bayot speaking area, while the west side of Mof-Ávvi coincides with the homeland of the Jóola Kaasa Húluf and Jóola Kaasa ÉsuulaaluʔThe map in Figure 2 below, adapted from Palmeri and Gazio (1995), shows a very approximate location of Mof-Ávvi in relation to other neighbouring speech communitiesSome of these communities will be referred to in our discussion of death prevention names in § 6The Eegimaa spoken in Mof-Ávvi is known by several names given by speakers of neighbouring languagesFor example, the name Kusiilay 1 ‘the language of Essil’, is the name given by speakers of Kujireray to the Eegimaa language, because Essil, of which Bajjat was a district, is the village which has a border with their villageEndungo is the name given by Bayot speakers, but its meaning is not knownKúlaakiay, ‘the language of village of Seleki/Sállagi’, is the name given by Jóola Kaasa speakers who are more familiar with the village of Seleki/Sállagi’ than all other villages of Mof-ÁvviFinally, Banjal/Bandial ‘the language of the village of Banjal’, the most popular of all those names, is the name given by the Jóola Búluf and Jóola Fogny speakers to Eegimaa people and their language, because people from the village of Banjal were the first to be in contact with themFigure 1Map of Senegal (courtesy of Google maps)Figure 2. Map of the Eegimaa speaking area. Village names are written using their usual spellingThe Ethnologue language codes are provided for language varieties that have themLanguage names are written following the recommendation for the transcription of national languages of Senegal, Decree 2005-981Names of the villages of Mof-Ávvi are written using the Eegimaa orthography and following the pronunciation of village names by native speakersJóola language varieties which are closely related to Eegimaa include Kujireray/Kuluunaay (from the village of Brin with 76% lexical similarity) and Gufiñamay (from the village of Afiniam with 74% lexical similarity (based on Lewis et al., 2014 eds.))Gútaamay (from the village of Butam), Gulapaoray (from the village Djilapaor) and Gusiilay (ISO 639-3: bsl) from the village of Thionk Essil are also other languages related to EegimaaThey are located north of the Casamance River in the Jóola Búluf areaThere are also small migrant Eegimaa communities in villages like Djifanghor (east of Ziguinchor) and in Bourofaye (south of Ziguinchor), where they cohabit with speakers of Baïnounk languagesNowadays most Eegimaa speakers from Mof-Ávvi live outside their homeland, generally in urban areas like Ziguinchor and DakarSpeakers of Eegimaa use the term Gújjolaay (meaning Jóola) to refer to their language when they speak to each other, but Eegimaa to distinguish their Jóola variety from that of other Jóola peoplesEegimaa is an endangered language whose transmission to new generations has been declining significantly in the last decadesIt is important to understand the contact situation of Eegimaa, because some of the ritual names analysed in this paper come from other languages or from neighbouring communitiesThese names are given either in Eegimaa or in a different language 
Antonín Dvořák Antonín Leopold Dvořák (/ d(ə)ˈvɔːrʒɑːk, -ʒæk / d(ə)-VOR-zha(h)k; Czech: [ˈantoɲiːn ˈlɛopolt ˈdvor̝aːk]; 8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904) was a Czech composerAfter Bedřich Smetana, he was the next Czech Romantic-era composer to achieve worldwide recognitionFollowing Smetana's nationalist example, Dvořák frequently employed aspects, specifically rhythms, of the folk music of Moravia and his native BohemiaDvořák's own style has been described as "the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them". [1] Antonín Dvořák Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age sixThe first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was aged 31Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades laterIn 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other worksAlthough Dvořák was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressedThe prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 [a] and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to himBrahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances, Op. 46These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvořák's international reputation was launched at lastDvořák's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. [2] In his career, Dvořák made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own worksHis Seventh Symphony was written for LondonVisiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. [3] In 1891 Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague ConservatoryIn 1890 – 91, he wrote his Dumky Trio, one of his most successful chamber music piecesIn 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York CityWhile in the United States, Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony From the New World, which spread his reputation worldwide, [4] and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concertiHe also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music, the American String Quartet, during this timeBut shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895All of Dvořák's nine operas but his first have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral worksBy far the most successful of the operas is RusalkaAmong his smaller works, the seventh Humoresque and the song "Songs My Mother Taught Me" are also widely performed and recordedHe has been described as "arguably the most versatile ... composer of his time".

Otto Jespersen Jens Otto Harry Jespersen or Otto Jespersen (Danish: [ʌtˢo ˈjɛsb̥ɐsn̩]; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English languageEarly life Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in JutlandHe was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy, and with the help of Rask's grammars taught himself some Icelandic, Italian, and SpanishHe entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17, initially studying law but not forgetting his language studiesIn 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages, and in 1887 earned his master's degree in French, with English and Latin as his secondary languagesHe supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliamentIn 1887 – 1888, he traveled to England, Germany and France, meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford UniversityFollowing the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen, he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case systemHe successfully defended his dissertation in 1891Academic life and work Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925, and served as Rector of the university in 1920 – 21His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics, but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language developmentHe advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers: Sprogets logik (1913) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser (1921)Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax, and differentiates between primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries; e.g. in "well honed phrase," "phrase" is a primary, this being defined by a secondary, "honed", which again is defined by a tertiary "well"The term Nexus is applied to sentences, structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation, in which two concepts are expressed in one unit; e.g., it rained, he ran indoorsThis term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea, expressed by means of two or more elements, whereas a nexus combines two ideasJunction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguisticsHe was most widely recognized for some of his booksLanguage: Its Nature, Development and Origin (1922) is considered by many to be his masterpieceModern English Grammar on Historical Principles (1909 – 1949), concentrated on morphology and syntax, and Growth and Structure of the English Language (1905) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language, and still in print, over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publicationLate in his life he published Analytic Syntax (1937), in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notationIn The Philosophy of Grammar (1924) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in Grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case, pronoun, object, voice etc., and developed further his notions of Rank and NexusIn the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern Structural linguisticsMankind, Nation and Individual: from a linguistic point of view (1925) is one of the pioneering works on SociolinguisticsJespersen visited the United States twice: he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904, and in 1909 – 1910 he visited both the University of California and Columbia UniversityWhile in the U.S., he took occasion to study the country's educational systemHis autobiography (see below) was published in English translation as recently as 1995Jespersen was a proponent of phonosemanticism and wrote: “Is there really much more logic in the opposite extreme which denies any kind of sound symbolism (apart from the small class of evident echoisms and ‘onomatopoeia’) and sees in our words only a collection of accidental and irrational associations of sound and meaning? ..There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for.” After his retirement in 1925, Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic communityIn addition to continuing to write, he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930, and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936Jespersen was an important figure in the international language movementHe was an early supporter of the Esperanto offshoot Ido and in 1927 published his own project NovialHe also worked with the International Auxiliary Language AssociationJespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York (1910), St. Andrews University in Scotland (1925), and the Sorbonne in Paris (1927)He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the Linguistic Society of America

Perfect Teeth Steven wanted to be a dentistIt was pretty much the first thing he told us when, as first years, we were all bunched together in the unfamiliar dusty classroomWhen, a couple of weeks later we were invited over to his house we saw that this was not an idle remarkWhere our bedroom walls were decorated with posters of pop stars and footballers, Steven had diagrams setting out tooth implementations, anatomical drawings of the jaw with brightly coloured nerves, muscle, blood vessels, bones, and, of course, teethWhere we had shelves of plastic dinosaurs and superhero figurines from cornflake boxes, Steven had plaster casts of jawbones, gums and teeth grinning down at usThe instruments were locked away in glass cabinets and only his parents had the key“They don’t exactly encourage my interest,” he shrugged“They sort of tolerate itBut Dad says they’re a sort of collection, and too expensive for me to play with.” Of course, we tried to pick the locks, but the spikes and saws and drillheads remained — tantalisingly — out of reachWe didn’t see Steven’s interest as strange, well, not that muchWe all had our own interests — drawing, electronics, collecting beer caps — that each appeared obscure to anyone elseDIY Dentistry was just something that had never crossed our horizon beforeAnd if Steven didn’t see it as weird, or no weirder than Andy showing us his Eastern-Block beer caps all laid out neatly on cork boards with little hand-written labels, why should it bother us? I suppose that, in our own way, we were all collectively strangeThe bunch that no one picked for their side at football or hockey, and that was the glue that held us togetherBesides, Steven had some really good stuff: sweets that stained your teeth bright red — well, technically, not your teeth, just the plaque, but the result was often the sameIt took a few days good brushing to get it offWell, most of it anywayHe had effervescent tablets that turned the canteen drinking water into that exact same pink mixture that the dentist gave you to rinse your mouth out after scraping around inside, and guaranteed to make the other kids splutter and spit it out when the taste slowly percolated through and met the memory of their last checkupThen there was the event that became the rite of passage into our group of misfits and outcasts: making a mould of your teethIt was inevitable that one of us, seeing the plaster casts on the shelf by Steven’s bed would ask how they were doneIt was just as inevitable that a few minutes later, Steven would be mixing up various powders and liquids, and pouring them into a horse-shoe shaped contraptionIt wasn’t dangerousAt least, I suppose soIt was vaguely uncomfortable, and appeared sufficiently disturbing that we all volunteered each other in turn until, at last, Andy said he was gameAnd we were offThe hardest part was probably to overcome the gagging reflex that set in when you bit down into the acrid resin jelly and it flowed out and up and around, over teeth, gums and tongueYour nose filled with what you imagined were fumes from the warm pasteAnd you seemed to be suddenly drowning in your own salivaThings generally got better when Steven reminded you that you could actually breathe, and swallow, normallyHe watched the second hand trotting round the dial of his watch mouthing the quarters, before poking the setting goo to check its consistencyThen, when he gave you the nod, you tried to prise your jaws apartAs the seal around your gums and teeth was pretty solid, you thought it would never come off, as the others giggled at your expressions and grimacesSteven jiggled the handle that stuck out beyond your front teeth like some metallic duck’s bill, turning and twisting it most professionally and murmuring encouragementsAnd, then, with an awful sucking slurp, it came freeThe initiated then revelled in retelling the gross sensation of having this evil-smelling plastic slug invade your mouth, while the others waited their turn with mixed trepidation and excitementRaucous laughter greeted the suggestions of the other body parts that could receive the same treatmentThe next part of the proceedings was less thrillingSteven measured and mixed the plaster of Paris and prepared for the cast by using a bright blue putty to build up the form of the jaw, and shoring up gaps and holesIt get even less exciting when he said we’d have to wait an hour while the plaster set real solidBut the next time we visited his room we got to marvel at our toothy grins labelled and lined up on the shelfWe were all perfectly happy with the result, even wanting one as a trophy until Steven passed an expert eye over them, pointing out here a gap, here a filling, and there a completely misaligned incisorWe were, he told us, mediocre specimens for his collectionIt didn’t matterWe were all friends, a group bonded by the common experience of being able to see our teeth on Steven’s shelf 
Wikinews interviews Christopher Hill, U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate Interview What qualifications do you have that will assist you in executing the duties of president? My Presidential qualifications are rooted in my service as an Officer in the United States Air ForceI took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years oldI understood it was an Oath to ALL of our peoplePoliticians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their votersAs President, I will serve ALL of the people in America, guided by the ConstitutionWhy run for president? Why not run for a lower office that you would be more likely to win and effect change? When I was a young man in Air Force ROTC I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro- NATO Joint Jet Pilot TrainingThe Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy, Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attendI volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the "Top of the Spear." In those days it was all or nothingIf you graduated you were assigned a fighter, if you were not quite fighter pilot material you had no response to fly another aircraft, you were washed outCongress has proven itself ineffective as a bodyTo make a difference in America you must have the "Bully Pulpit" and speak to the PeopleThe President has that pulpitAll or nothingI never wanted to make politics a careerWhy did you choose to run in the Republican Party? My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979, when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New HampshireIn those days I believed there was a difference in the partiesToday, like many Americans, I am skepticalI understand third party candidates have no successI hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working class AmericansHow do you plan to get into the Republican debates and make an impact on polls? In order to be invited to the debates, we must raise money and poll nationallyThis is an effort that is underwayRecently we were listed in New Hampshire and nationally with Politics1If you do not receive the Republican nomination, would you consider running as a third party candidate? No, I will back the nominee of the Republican party in 2016After that, I may reconsiderOther than yourself, which candidates have you supported for president in previous campaigns? Reagan in 80 and 84, [George H. W.] Bush in 88 and 92, [Phil] Gramm in 96, [George W.] Bush in 2000 and, Romney in 08What are your thoughts on the job Barack Obama has done as president? Specifically, what would you have done differently? President Obama has an agenda that represents the far left wing of his partyHis use of the Presidency to further this agenda has in many ways been unconstitutionalSpecifically, altering law once it is passed to accommodate his voting blocsHis direction to Eric Holder to enforce some laws and not others is another exampleHill at the Lesser-known candidates forum in 2011 If elected, what would constitute a successful presidency for you? Achieving four goals: Term Limits for Congress and the Courts returning government to the PeopleImplementing a Tax System that allows working Americans making under $ 250,000 to keep all of their moneyClosing Loopholes and putting in place a system that is transparent and worksPassing a Living Wage program lifting people out of povertyReturning America to a state of Peace and SecurityWhat individuals would you like to see in a Hill administration? I would like to bring People from the heartland of America that make this nation workWe have had too many decades of Ivy League elites and Professors immersed in theoryHill (right) with fellow 2012 presidential candidate Buddy RoemerAnything else you would like to add? A final thoughtAmerica is a nation that will endureI believe it is our responsibility to pass on the same opportunities to future generations that were promised to usAs President, I intend to keep that promise!  
Wikinews interviews Robert Sarvis, Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Virginia Saturday, October 19, 2013 Attorney Robert Sarvis, the Libertarian Party's nominee for Governor of Virginia, answered five questions submitted via e-mail by accredited Wikinews reporter William SaturnSarvis has garnered double digits in opinion polls for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election, an unusual feat for a third party candidateThe latest Newsmax / Zogby poll from late September placed him at 13 percent, 14 points behind Republican Party nominee Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia's Attorney General, and 19 points behind Democratic Party nominee Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, with 24 percent undecidedWhoever wins election on November 5, 2013, would replace outgoing governor Bob McDonnellOn his campaign website, Sarvis notes he favors parental school choice through student vouchers, simplification of Virginia's Tax Code, US Second Amendment - gun - rights, same-sex marriage, and reform of the state's drug lawsWith Wikinews, Sarvis discusses his background, views on McDonnell's tenure, keys to campaign success, plan to implement his agenda, and the former Virginia governor he most admiresInterview What is the most important aspect of your background that voters should know about? I am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia, but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth(I am mixed-race (half-Chinese) and in an interracial marriage.) I am the only candidate who has studied both economics and law, and the only candidate with a background in technology entrepreneurshipBecause of my academic and professional background, I understand the issues and challenges facing Virginia much better than the other candidates, and I am offering real solutions that can be appreciated across the political spectrumI am the only candidate who believes in both economic freedom and personal liberty and the only candidate who stands on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of lawWhat are your thoughts on the job Bob McDonnell has done as Governor of Virginia? What would you have done differently than him? McDonnell did well early in his term pushing back against Senate Democrats who wanted huge tax increases in response to major revenue shortfalls during the recessionThose early budget efforts are his highest achievements as GovernorMore recently, he erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases, rather than prioritizing spending and seeking more rational, efficient, decentralized transportation decision-makingHe could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform, regulatory reform, and school choiceOf course, he showed ethical lapses in judgmentCompared to previous third party candidates at the gubernatorial level, you have done exceptionally well in opinion pollingWhat do you attribute that success to? Voters see the two-party system for the sham it has becomeThey are sick of the partisanship and nonsense and the total lack of substance in modern campaignsVoters see the two major party nominees as exemplifying what is worst about their respective parties, and they want something betterVoters who meet me and hear me speak know that I am sincere, know that I understand the issues deeply and have workable solutions, and know that I stand on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law and the public interestPeople like the fact that I stand for a Virginia that is both Open-minded and Open for BusinessIf elected governor, how will you be able to implement your agenda while dealing with a hostile legislature? There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature, and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governorLibertarians share many policy positions with each of the major partiesWorking together with both Republicans and Democrats, we can get the good aspects of each party while rejecting the bad parts of bothMoreover, electing a third-party governor represents a repudiation of politics as usual, and the major party legislators will face changed constraints and incentives, meaning that much more is possible than many people assume, especially with strong leadershipWhich previous Virginia Governor(s) do you most admire and why? Thomas JeffersonHe was incredibly learned and was a strong advocate for freedom and the rule of lawHe would be a Libertarian todayRobert SarvisImage: Sarvis for GovernorVirginia, highlighted in redImage: Huebi

Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York CitySpace Shuttle Discovery will take the place of Enterprise at the Udvar-Hazy CenterDiscovery has already been retired following the completion of STS-133 last month, its 39th missionDiscovery is undergoing decommissioning and currently being prepped for display by removing toxic materials from the orbiterLooking back: Space Shuttle Columbia lifts off on STS-1 from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on April 12, 1981Image: NASASpace Shuttle Endeavour, which will launch on STS-134 at the end of the month on April 29, will be sent to the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California following its retirementFinally, Atlantis will go on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex following the orbiter's last flight which launches June 28Columbia was lost tragically back on February 1, 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry killing all seven astronauts aboardSpace Shuttle Challenger was lost when it exploded 73 seconds after liftoff back on January 28, 1986 killing all six aboard"We want to thank all of the locations that expressed an interest in one of these national treasures," said Bolden to the gathered crowd which contained many KSC employees"This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mindIn the end, these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle ProgramThese facilities we've chosen have a noteworthy legacy of preserving space artifacts and providing outstanding access to U.S. and international visitors." This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mindIn the end, these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle ProgramCharles Bolden, NASA Administrator File image of Space Shuttle Atlantis lifting off, which approaches its last mission before retirementImage: NASANot all were pleased with the final choice of locationsU.S. Senator John Cornyn, Republican from Texas, issued a statement regarding the rejection of Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas as a location"Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASA's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the Space Shuttle OrbitersHouston has played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle, but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet." Cornyn's statement added, "There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters — even Administrator Bolden stated as muchToday's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the State of Texas, and Im deeply disappointed with the Administration's misguided decision.“ However, the JSC will recieve pilot and commander seats from the flight deckThe Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington was also proposed as another location for a shuttle, going so far as to build a new building to house an orbiterIn a statement, Governor of Washington Chris Gregoire said, "The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific NorthwestAs the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fitWhile the Museum of Flight was in the top running, Im disappointed that NASA did not choose themIn 2008, Endeavour and Atlantis await a journey on their respective launchpadsImage: NASA"However, the full fuselage trainer, that every astronaut including [former Museum of Flight CEO] Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on, will soon call the Museum of Flight homeThe largest of the trainers, this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts getVisitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museumIt will help inspire young people to the adventure of space and to the excitement of a career in science, technology, engineering and math." Today's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the State of Texas, and Im deeply disappointed with the Administration's misguided decisionJohn Cornyn, U.S. Senator (R-Texas) Other items include various shuttle simulators which will be given to the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois, the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum of McMinnville, Oregon, and Texas A&M's Aerospace Engineering DepartmentThe nose cap assembly and crew compartment trainer for the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and orbital maneuvering system engines for the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Evergreen Aviation & Space MuseumNASA is also offering shuttle heat shield tiles to schools and universities that want to share technology and a piece of space history with their studentsThe 30th anniversary of the first shuttle mission coincided with the 50th anniversary of the first manned space flight when Yuri Gagarin lifted off aboard Vostok 1 into space 
Sensitive Canadian document found on rainy streets Friday, August 15, 2008 A sensitive Environment Canada document was found wet on an Ottawa street by someone who gave it to the CBC todayThe 131-page document was found on Castlefrank Road in Kanata, Ontario in a rain-stained, tire-marked brown envelope by a passerbyThe document which had the stamp Protected B on every page detailed various security vulnerabilities of the NEMISIS database which is used by officers to track and prosecute environmental law-breakersIf someone were able to shut the system down, or hack inside and delete or corrupt the information, it could affect the prosecution of the lawbreakersThe database was unveiled in 1999 as the National Enforcement Management Information System and Intelligence SystemHowever, on the document, it referred to the database as National Enforcement and Emergency Management Information System and Intelligence System, adding the words "and Emergency" to the nameProtection B documents are the second lowest grade of classified government documentsEnvironment Canada spokesperson Julie Hahn said they apply to letters of complaint, criticism or injury, research or scientific notes and findings that don`t have any conclusion, and Treasury Board letters, agendas and minutes that don`t deal with subjects of national interestEnvironment Minister John Baird has asked government officials how such documents that are supposed to be stored in "approved security cabinets" wound up on the street"I'm told two things: that it's neither classified nor secret and that it's stuff that could be available under access to information," Baird saidEnvironment Canada spokeswoman Sujata Raisinghani told CBC News the department will look into the incident"We take document security seriously," she said, but refused to give any more details about how the papers came to be on a roadPaul Dewar, an Ottawa New Democrat MP, said the combined security lapses raise serious questions about the government's ability to secure sensitive documentsDewar says that bureaucrats of the Conservative government have complained to him about document security to the point that they can`t share the information with their own colleaguesHowever, when a government document has been found on the streets, the government then says it wasn't particularly sensitive"This government is so consumed with control of information and secrecy yet they don't seem to be able to get the fundamentals right," Dewar saidThe incident is a reminiscent of two other incidentsIn March, a bundle of blueprints for a new headquarters for the military's counterterrorism unit were found stuffed in the trash on a downtown streetIn May, Maxime Bernier was forced to resign as Foreign Affairs minister after it became known that he left sensitive documents at the apartment of his then-girlfriend Julie Couillard who had ties to the Hells Angels biker gangSources "Sensitive government document found on rainy Ottawa street" — CBC.ca, August 15, 2008 "Document found on street not secret, say feds" — The Canadian Press, August 15, 2008 "Environment Canada security report found on street" — Toronto Star, August 15, 2008 Peter Zimonjic"MP calls for probe into misplaced documents" — Edmonton Sun, August 16, 2008 Categories: August 15, 2008 Canada Published North America Politics and conflicts Environment Canada Archived  
Escape The Room Employees, what is the weirdest thing you've seen someone do in one of the rooms? The most depressing shit I saw was a tired looking couple who brought in their bespectacled, NASA shirt wearing, 8 year old geek of a son in to have some funThe parents couldn't have been more discouraging to himHe was excitedly bouncing around the room pointing out things that he thought were clues clues while the parents dismissed every idea he had and told him to stop getting so excitedThe parents took charge and proceeded to ignore the obvious clues he was pointing out and spent most of the time pursuing dead endsSad part is his instincts were more often than not correct but his parents just didn't listen and refused to let him explore and try stuff outHopefully his curiosity and enthusiasm survives themI feel like if it were in my power in any way, that kid would have led his parents right through the damned thingIf I were the 'operator' of that site, at the end I would have walked the family through every damn clue the kid noticed and made sure the parents knew the kid was rightThey probably won't and he will develop chronic depressionMeirl That would seem to suggest parents aren't all knowing geniusesSay it a nit so!! I will not go Turn the lights off Carry me home NANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANA It amazes me the chunks of time it takes for people to respond to these things D:> 1 year later Late night, come home Work sucks, I know She left me roses by the stairsNot to over step my boundaries but ... what cuntsThat poor child deserves to be encouraged and listened to. :( This is the flaw with the premise of the movie IdiocracyMy parents always did that when I was a kid whenever there was a problem that needing thinking through they never let me help or dismissed every idea I had simply because I was understandably a kid but you still have to at least let your kids try and help or take their suggestions seriously Thats infuriating because the whole point is to be adventurous and curious OH WAIT I THOUGHT OF ANOTHER ONE So we do proposalsRing in the final puzzle box, proposal signs, whole package deal, people love itDude calls up to set up a proposal, I ask what room he wants etceteraSo then I tell him the total price to book out the entire room for the proposalHe says he just wants to buy the two tickets for him and his girlfriend, I tell him we can't have strangers playing a game that their experience is impacted/altered by the fact that there's a proposal going onProposal happens in an Escape Room, there's no longer a game, it becomes about the proposalI know this because I've seen it happen a hundred timesAnyway, dude refuses to buy out all of the ticketsSays he wants strangers to be there, he's not going to buy the other four ticketsI hand the phone to my manager, they hash out details togetherOver the next three weeks leading up to the proposal, this guy calls every. Single. Fucking. DayThere's nothing else to figure out, we've got it all set up, but this guy is constantly badgering usThe big day rolls around, he arrives early so he can hide out, and this dude is a kidLike, pimple-faced, voice-cracking, hair-growing-in-weird-places kind of kidEverybody in the control room is talking about him, because he's been a thorn in our collective sides for weeks, and we're speculating about telling him marriage at his age is a horrible idea, but whatever it's too lateSo he hides, the girl and her friends show up, they get started and we stash the dude in the second hidden room that they'll eventually end up inEverybody crowds around the monitor to watch and this guy pulls out a bouquet of flowers and unfurls a sign that says "NAME REDACTED, will you go with me to PROM?" And the entire staff loses their collective shitWeeks of constant pestering, endless phone calls, and the most stressful proposal deal we've ever put togetherFor a fucking PROMposalShe said nocheers for the girl saying no Made my day"Shes said no" You ok? What a fucking niche name.parents must have been hippies who thought their daughter didn't need to be labeled by societyOr Ron SwansonAND IM DEAD  
[Monsters Inc] Monstropolis is the only city in a destroyed world This is pieced together from random bits from both movies Monsters, Inc. is the only company ever mentioned in relation to the energy crisisNo one else is stepping up to help solve what should be a civilization-impacting problemIs it more likely that they are supplying power to only one city, or to an entire world? This is further underlined when dialogue from the second movie only ever refers to Monsters, Inc as the destination for those who want to be scarers (which incidentally, only seem to come from two schools, both of which are also apparently in the city)Also, it is interesting to note that Boo going through the door into the Monster World was said to be "the first time in Monster History", and if there were other companies using Door Tech, you would think this would have happened before and there would be protocols for itThe All-Time Scare Record covers only Monsters, Inc, with no indication that there is anyone else at any other companies to compete withWaternoose mentions that the company has been in his family for "3 generations" (Alluding to a possible timeline for energy research in the Monster World, but that's a whole other theory), and he seems unusually attached to itMost rich people would take advantage of other options and be unconcerned about 1 companybut something in the way he says it (especially since he is not the sole owner, given his concern about the Board of Directors) suggests that there simply are no other options for himWhy wouldn't there be other options for him in a decent-sized world? Monstropolis is the only city ever mentionedNo indication that the supposedly-massive energy crisis is causing problems anywhere else, like in other, less-wealthy countries When trying to get rid of Boo, Mike makes several interesting statements: a. He refers to digging a tunnel under the city b. Using these to release Boo into "The Wild" c. And he has previously discarded ideas involving an enormous slingshot and a gigantic wooden horse Why would tunnels be necessary? Why all the planning in the first place? Why not just stuff Boo in the trunk of his car, drive her out of city limits, and set her loose? Because he can'tAnd what are all these things good at doing? Getting past wallsAnd walls, especially ones you can't get past, are usually there for a reasonBut what reason? We've seen gigantic monsters in both movies, so the most likely reason seems to be that there are things out there that put even these kaiju to shame, or else they could simply march outside and kill whatever is threatening Monster civilizationBut even this presents a problem, because then the Monsters could still periodically leave the city like Attack on TitanYet Mike's apparent refusal to consider going through any possible gates aside from an ridiculously overkill idea suggests that if any gates do exist, they are tightly sealed against all but the most extreme of circumstancesWhy would they be sealed if the Monsters could leave? The simplest explanation for this is that the very environment is hostile to the MonstersWhat kind of environment could "The Wild" be? A never-ending wasteland like the Glowing Sea? A land that has already mutated some lifeforms into Lovecraftian horrors that stalk the land looking for lesser life to consume? Could this land be related to some event that caused Monster civilization to reject other forms of energy in favor of relatively safe, non-volatile scream energy? What if the world surrounding Monstropolis is the human world? The only thing the monsters seem to be scared of is a human child, believing them to be toxic and deadlyMaybe they found a way to keep their city hidden from humans since they are scared of us and the door system isn't actually taking them to another dimension but somewhere else on the same planet ..That makes more sense, why would monsters be afraid of monsters? They wouldn't ... IF whatever was outside was like themWhich raises the question: what do monsters consider monsters? Humans It seems unlikely, since if that were the case, they could simply talk to the humans who could then work with them to provide any number of energy solutions that don't involve screamsPlus, despite the tech we've seen monsters use, we've never seen them use any cloaking tech (something that would no doubt come in useful for scarers) for something even monster-sized, let alone something that could hide an entire city And don't forget that they talk about the two worlds as if they actually ARE two different worldsIf they were on the same planet, it would make much more sense to talk about borders and being outside the boundaries (Remember, when Mike and Sully are tossed into the Himalayas, Mike's rant about being in the human world implies that they are not merely outside whatever is surrounding Monstropolis)  
This year has once again confirmed the importance of the United Nations as the truly indispensable multilateral forum for addressing today’s global problemsThe humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa, ecological disasters such as Fukushima, political developments like the Arab Spring and terrorist attacks such as the assault on the United Nations building in Abuja last August require concerted action by the United Nations and its Member StatesTen years after 9/11, joint action in the fight against terrorism continues to remain central on the multilateral agendaIn the past nine months, we have witnessed momentous changes in the Arab world that nobody expected when we met one year agoPressure for change is driven by the wish of women and men to choose their own fate and to improve their chances for a better lifeThese are legitimate demandsAn overwhelming number of young people were at the forefront of this enormous tide, which started in Tunisia and EgyptWe should pay tribute to their courageIn Libya, thousands lost their lives in the struggle for freedom and democracyIn Syria, and to some extent in Yemen, the suppression is ongoingAustria strongly condemns the systematic human rights violations and the violence against peaceful demonstratorsWe strongly urge those responsible to immediately stop the bloodshed and to engage in meaningful dialogue and reformsAustria supports the Libyan people in its struggle for freedomOver € 150 million blocked in Austrian bank accounts has been de-frozen for humanitarian useBoth the Austrian Government and private sector have provided medicine, relief supplies and desperately needed fuel to LibyaThe international community and the United Nations have to support and assist the transition process in the Arab world as the United Nations does now in LibyaThis period of change may last for some time and will be full of challengesAustria welcomes all efforts undertaken by Governments in the region for peaceful and credible changeWe encourage the newly empowered authorities to create a constitutional framework based on democracy and human rights, in order to fulfil their mandate for democratic change responsibly and peacefullyThe events in the Arab world notwithstanding, we must continue to focus on the Middle East peace processThe Middle East took centre stage this week here at the General Assembly — and rightly soWe must build trust and we have to foster the belief among Israelis and Palestinians that a negotiated settlement can be achieved — a sustainable solution based on two States living side by side in a secure and peaceful neighbourhood within mutually recognized bordersWe have no choice but to return to direct negotiations between the two partiesThe Quartet, in its statement yesterday, has shown a way to do that and has also proposed concrete timelinesAustria fully supports the Quartet statementThere is no time to loseAustria welcomes President Al-Nasser’s choice of theme for this year’s general debateWe appreciate Qatar’s strong track record in that regardLast year’s tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security reminded us that the promise of women’s full and equal participation in all efforts of maintaining peace and security, including in mediation processes, has not yet come true and that we all need to intensify our effortsIn that context, let me also mention an Austrian contribution to international mediation effortsBy inviting political decision-makers from both Khartoum and Juba to Vienna in recent years, Austria has managed to offer the two sides a platform for discussionWe are ready to continue to do soThe Sudan and South Sudan have a shared past and must resolve their remaining problems peacefullyThe United Nations headquarters in Vienna serves as a dynamic hub for the promotion of peace, security and sustainable developmentI am proud to announce that a liaison office of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs will open in Vienna soonOver the past year, the International Anti-Corruption Academy set up its headquarters near Vienna, and the Vienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation and an office of the International Peace Institute were establishedAustria fully stands behind the campaign launched by the Secretary-General on Monday to achieve universal access to modern energy servicesWe support doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030Austria provides substantial support to the energy and environment efforts undertaken by the United Nations Industrial Development OrganizationLast June, we hosted the Vienna Energy Forum, where about 1,400 participants discussed alternative energy concepts to reach the energy goals of the United NationsThe Fukushima nuclear catastrophe should become a turning point in our approach to nuclear safetyWe

I wish to make a ministerial statement about the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in New ZealandOn Friday, 28 February, New Zealand recorded its first case of the COVID-19 coronavirus, becoming the 48th country to have a confirmed caseThe individual had entered the country two days earlier after spending some weeks in Iran, which is currently experiencing a sizable outbreak of the diseaseI can report to the House that they are currently in a stable and improving condition at Auckland HospitalThe good news in this instance is that the individual had limited contact with people upon their return to the country, and their family took all the appropriate measures when presenting at the emergency departmentAs you would expect, our public health service is working hard to contain this first case and limit the risk of any spread of the diseaseContact tracing began immediately and has gone to planAll 15 people who were seated nearby the individual on their flight into New Zealand have been traced and are being told to self-isolatePublic health staff will remain in touch with individuals to monitor the situation and give ongoing adviceAll but 10 of the remaining passengers on the flight, who are not considered to be close contacts, have also been contacted to provide reassurance and answer any questions they might have; those 10 that haven't been contacted did not provide accurate contact informationI'm advised that as a result of our decisive response, the chance of an outbreak from our first case is lowInternationally, the situation with COVID-19 continues to develop at paceHowever, the Director-General of the World Health Organization said, this morning, containment … is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countriesThis is exactly the approach that New Zealand is taking, using three main tools: border controls; self-isolation; and good public health practices, including highlighting the importance of basic hygieneAt every step, the Government has taken decisions in the interests of health and safety of the wider public, and so far we have been among the best at keeping COVID-19 at bayJust yesterday, Cabinet decided to extend for another week the travel restrictions that have been in place for China since 3 February and for Iran since last FridayThese restrictions have played a key role in keeping COVID-19 out of New Zealand for so long and have given us time to better understand the disease and ramp up our preparationsOf course, members will be aware that there are outbreaks in other regions as wellSo, as a further precaution, we have decided that anyone arriving in New Zealand who has been in northern Italy or South Korea who has been there in the last 14 days will be registered for self-isolationThis is based on an expert assessment of riskIt recognises that while there are outbreaks in both countries, they also have well-developed health systems and the outbreaks are largely located in specific regionsWe know self-isolation worksIt is a longstanding and successful approach to managing infectious diseases and has proven its worth again in recent weeksWe have also stepped up the health presence at our airportsAll airlines flying into New Zealand have been requested to read a health message upon landing, and all arrivals into New Zealand will receive health information cards alongside the standard customs declaration formAs a result of decisions taken on Friday, health staff are meeting all direct international flights landing in New Zealand airports from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and ThailandOur border response is further ramping up to have health staff available for all international flights into New ZealandAll these decisions and actions are designed to limit the spread of any sporadic COVID-19 cases that might arrive in New ZealandAt the same time, our health system continues its preparations in line with our comprehensive pandemic planI want to thank our DHBs, public health staff, and primary care and health officials for the work they are doing to protect the publicI have high confidence in our medical professionalsWe have a strong public health systemWe continue to work to keep COVID-19 out, but we are ready if it arrives in our community 
2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory By the end of this section, you will be able to: State the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory Use postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, the scientists of their dayIn the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for “indivisible.” They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join togetherLater, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “elements” —fire, earth, air, and water—and could be infinitely dividedInterestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and “elements” as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideasThe Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theoryFirst published in 1807, many of Dalton’s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theoryHere are the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory1. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atomsAn atom is the smallest unit of an element that can participate in a chemical change2. An element consists of only one type of atom, which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is the same for all atoms of that element (Figure 2.2)A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms, all of which have identical chemical propertiesFigure 2.2 A pre-1982 copper penny (left) contains approximately 3 ×× 1022 copper atoms (several dozen are represented as brown spheres at the right), each of which has the same chemical properties(credit: modification of work by “slgckgc” / Flickr) 3. Atoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements4. A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small, whole-number ratioIn a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio (Figure 2.3)Figure 2.3 Copper(II) oxide, a powdery, black compound, results from the combination of two types of atoms—copper (brown spheres) and oxygen (red spheres)—in a 1:1 ratio(credit: modification of work by “Chemicalinterest”/Wikimedia Commons) 5. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are instead rearranged to yield substances that are different from those present before the change (Figure 2.4)Figure 2.4 When the elements copper (a shiny, red-brown solid, shown here as brown spheres) and oxygen (a clear and colorless gas, shown here as red spheres) react, their atoms rearrange to form a compound containing copper and oxygen (a powdery, black solid)(credit copper: modification of work by http://images-of-elements.com/copper.php) Dalton’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you’ve learned aboutFor example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atomsAnd if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter)EXAMPLE 2.1 Testing Dalton’s Atomic Theory In the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain elementThe purple spheres represent atoms of another elementIf the spheres touch, they are part of a single unit of a compoundDoes the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s atomic theory? If so, which one? Solution The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheresThe products consist of only one green sphere and one purple sphereThis violates Dalton’s postulate that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed(In this case, atoms appear to have been destroyed.) Check Your Learning In the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain elementThe purple spheres represent atoms of another elementIf the spheres touch, they are part of a single unit of a compoundDoes the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s atomic theory? If so, which one? ANSWER: The starting materials consist of four green spheres and two purple spheresThe products consist of four green spheres and two purple spheresThis does not violate any of Dalton’s postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios 
15.4 The Union Triumphant Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the reasons why many Americans doubted that Abraham Lincoln would be reelected Explain how the Union forces overpowered the Confederacy Describe the contributions and experiences of African Americans serving in the Civil War By the outset of 1864, after three years of war, the Union had mobilized its resources for the ongoing struggle on a massive scaleThe government had overseen the construction of new railroad lines and for the first time used standardized rail tracks that allowed the North to move men and materials with greater easeThe North’s economy had shifted to a wartime modelThe Confederacy also mobilized, perhaps to a greater degree than the Union, its efforts to secure independence and maintain slaveryYet the Confederacy experienced ever - greater hardships after years of warWithout the population of the North, it faced a shortage of manpowerThe lack of industry, compared to the North, undercut the ability to sustain and wage warRampant inflation as well as food shortages in the South lowered moraleTHE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE From the beginning of the war, the Confederacy placed great hope in being recognized and supported by Great Britain and FranceEuropean intervention in the conflict remained a strong possibility, but when it did occur, it was not in a way anticipated by either the Confederacy or the UnionNapoleon III of France believed the Civil War presented an opportunity for him to restore a French empire in the AmericasWith the United States preoccupied, the time seemed ripe for actionNapoleon’s target was Mexico, and in 1861, a large French fleet took VeracruzThe French then moved to capture Mexico City, but the advance came to an end when Mexican forces defeated the French in 1862Despite this setback, France eventually did conquer Mexico, establishing a regime that lasted until 1867Rather than coming to the aid of the Confederacy, France used the Civil War to provide a pretext for efforts to reestablish its former eighteenth - century colonial holdingsStill, the Confederacy had great confidence that it would find an ally in Great Britain despite the antislavery sentiment thereSoutherners hoped Britain’s dependence on cotton for its textile mills would keep the country on their sideThe fact that the British proved willing to build and sell ironclad ships intended to smash through the Union naval blockade further raised Southern hopesThe Confederacy purchased two of these armored blockade runners, the CSS Florida and the CSS AlabamaBoth were destroyed during the warThe Confederacy’s staunch commitment to slavery eventually worked against British recognition and support, since Great Britain had abolished slavery in 1833The 1863 Emancipation Proclamation ended any doubts the British had about the goals of the Union causeIn the aftermath of the proclamation, many in Great Britain cheered for a Union victoryUltimately, Great Britain, like France, disappointed the Confederacy’s hope of an alliance, leaving the outnumbered and out - resourced states that had left the Union to fend for themselvesAFRICAN AMERICAN SOLDIERS At the beginning of the war, in 1861 and 1862, Union forces had used contrabands, or escaped enslaved people, for manual laborThe Emancipation Proclamation, however, led to the enrollment of African American men as Union soldiersHuge numbers of formerly enslaved as well as free Black people from the North enlisted, and by the end of the war in 1865, their numbers had swelled to over 190,000Racism among White people in the Union army ran deep, however, fueling the belief that Black soldiers could never be effective or trustworthyThe Union also feared for the fate of captured Black soldiersAlthough many Black soldiers saw combat duty, these factors affected the types of tasks assigned to themMany Black regiments were limited to hauling supplies, serving as cooks, digging trenches, and doing other types of labor, rather than serving on the battlefield (Figure 15.16)Figure 15.16 This 1865 daguerreotype illustrates three of the Union’s distinct advantages: African American soldiers, a stream of cannons and supplies, and an extensive railroad grid. (credit: Library of Congress) African American soldiers also received lower wages than their White counterparts: ten dollars per month, with three dollars deducted for clothingWhite soldiers, in contrast, received thirteen dollars monthly, with no deductionsAbolitionists and their Republican supporters in Congress worked to correct this discriminatory practice, and in 1864, Black soldiers began to receive the same pay as White soldiers plus retroactive pay to 1863 (Figure 15.17)Figure 15.17 African American and White soldiers of the Union army pose together in this photograph, although in reality, Black soldiers were often kept separate and given only menial jobsFor their part, African American soldiers welcomed the opportunity to prove themselvesSome 85 percent were formerly enslaved people who were fighting for the liberation of all of the enslaved and the end of slaveryWhen given the opportunity to serve, many Black regiments did so heroicallyOne such regiment, the Fifty-Fourth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers, distinguished itself at Fort Wagner in South Carolina by fighting valiantly against an entrenched Confederate positionThey willingly gave their lives for the causeThe Confederacy, not surprisingly, showed no mercy to African American troopsIn April 1864, Southern forces attempted to take Fort Pillow in Tennessee from the Union forces that had captured it in 1862Confederate troops under Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, the future founder of the Ku Klux Klan, quickly overran the fort, and the Union defenders surrenderedInstead of taking the African American soldiers prisoner, as they did the White soldiers, the Confederates executed themThe massacre outraged the North, and the Union refused to engage in any future exchanges of prisoners with the Confederacy 
Hey it’s Jackie and welcome back to my vlog channelWe are currently in the car yet again and we’re driving to Alexander SpringsOf course we’re doing another mermaid photo shootIt’s not quite summer but it feels like summer here and I never miss a year of mermaid contentThis theme is a Grecian mermaidI really wanted to do something with pearls and do an updo and then have really bronzy makeupAnd the tail, we have a silicone tail this time, is very similar to this lip tone, and my friend Marianne is staying with us and I love her photography style and stylingSo she actually made this kind of Grecian top, like, very quickly, and I can’t wait to see this locationIt’s gonna be beautifulAnd then after that we are headed to Orlando, I’m gonna see my parents and we’re doing Harry Potter WorldWe had to go into this little corner store because um we had to pee and we had to get five dollars worth of stuffSaw this place on the corner of the roadWhat is this? We love tackyThis place is so coolWhat’s in there? Doing some touch-ups before we head into the springs and I’m using this really beautiful Mac blush, this is the shade Melon PinkFor eyes I’ve been using the Dominique ‘the Moment Palette’I used this in my last video but instead of going with the blues I went with these shades here and I love these togetherSee if I can get you in hereOh hey!

Oh no that’s not going anywhereJump from one bed to the other, like a childAnd we’re doing Universal tomorrowWe are all so loopy but I think we are gonna watch a little bit of Harry Potter Good morning! This is the Harry Potter World outfit of the dayWe did not get up as early as we should haveWow, what are you doing? I booked the tickets for the wrong day and that was stressful, but I ended up getting them switched, and we finally made itWe’re here! Wow! And welcome to Hogsmeade! For the best experience get a park to park ticket so you can do both Hogsmeade and Diagon AlleyThis was my favorite area in the park, maybe because it wasn’t as crowded yet and the wand shop is so epicEverything is really detailed and when you look up even on the way going into the shop there are owls that move up highYou know I gotta go with the kidBut there’s so many pretty ones! Marianne, which one are you going to get? I don’t know, I’m looking at every single one! It’s a big choiceSo we got our wands from the shop, and apparently they’re interactiveWe don’t actually know what we’re doing, but here is my wandCheers! Cheers! Try it out! Oh yeah! Oh my gosh!

Sorry! So we just went on at the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey rideYou can see that Hogwarts right thereAnd it was so fun, like, I’m not a rides person, but, um, it felt like you were flyingIt was very magicalSo, highly recommend going thereAnd the wait wasn’t even that bad, so yeahHow did you like it? I loved itI was a little scaredOh that is so fun! How did you do that? With the park to park ticket we took the train to Diagon Alley and for lunch we went to the Leaky Cauldron, which has a bunch of British themed foodI would say the food is like a 5 out of 10It wasn’t amazing but it was a really cool spot 
Hey what's up guys? Welcome back to my channel or welcome if you're new. Today I'm doing another college day in my lifeAnd I just left Starbucks, don't mind what I look likeI literally just pretty much woke up and left this morningI'm starting the review for all the chapters for my final exam, and it is a lot of information so I already planned on getting up early today and goingAnd then I'm gonna do the same thing tomorrowI basically like created a digital calendar where I'm gonna go over each of the chapters, just because I only have one week left to studyI'm back home now, and I basically just typed up a little calendar laying out the chapters that I have left to review before TuesdayThat's my final list and I hate that, like, this week is our Thanksgiving break and then we literally come back Tuesday and take our finalSo I'm gonna be studying on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and the whole weekend even though we're going getting our Christmas tree I think on Saturday, and I I'm not decorating I'm not doing anything fun, like I have to studyI thought I would show you guys kind of how I'm mapping this out, because it's a really good tip if you have like a lot to doSo today I'm doing female reproductive system, male reproductive system tomorrowI work on Wednesday, I'm going to go over chapter 29 fluid balance, chapter 28 so urinary system on the 29thThe 30th, Chapters 17 through 22 - yes that's like six chapters or somethingAnd then on Sunday, I'll be doing chapters 23 through 27 and I just made this on my iPad and then printed itI did not include my schedule for college algebra because I have a final on Thursday of next week for thatSo I'm going to go in with like a different color and add in the chapters I'm gonna be studying for that, but I'm super stressedI bought these Vans from DSWThey are really cuteYou guys know I have the white ones and I wear them all the time and these ones are just like black perforated VansI love them and they are definitely the right size because I have two other pairs of Vans that are this size, but one of these ones is like messed up or somethingI think it's like this part on the left foot because my foot feels super tight in only the left side, so something's up because they're both the right size but I don't knowSo I'm gonna exchange them for another pair because something's not right about thatHey guysSo I just got finished at the libraryI just sat in there for like an hour and a half straight and studiedI'm really proud of myself and now I'm about to go get some lunch, and go to DSW and see if I can exchange those VansSo while I was in the library one of you guys came up to me, and said hiI feel so bad because I was so in the zone that I didn't even get her nameBut if you're watching this, hi thank you so much for coming and saying hi to me you actually made my whole dayShe said she watches my videos and loves themAnd you guys are so sweet, I love making videos and it's so nice to have that supportSo if you do go to FGCU and you ever see me on campus, like feel free to say hi because you'll make my dayI just got out of DSW, and I spent like 30 minutes in there because it was just such a process for them to do an exchangeAnd then she had to scan and go get the shoes and then she said they didn't have the sizeSo I ended up having to order them, but she said there was no way to do a direct exchangeSo she had to give me a return and then re-ring it upAnd oh my gosh I was literally in there for like 25 minutes all to just do a simple exchange for the exact same shoeBut it's over now and they're gonna send them to me in the mailHopefully they'll be here in about a weekI'm just kind of sad that they didn't have them in stock, so now I have to waitBut oh well it's over with now, we're gonna go get lunch 
Understand Some of the distinctive skyline of Downtown, including the Kaiser Building and the Cathedral of Christ the LightOften overshadowed by San Francisco, its larger neighbor lying directly to the west, Oakland has in recent years began to step out from under the shadows, playing upon the beautiful highlights of its own and its rise as the multicultural "hipster' city of the Bay AreaSince the 1960s, Oakland has been a hub of radical culture, and is the birthplace of both the Black Panther Party and the Hell's AngelsOakland's history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well, as Oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Amy Tan, and Maya Angelou; actors Meryl Streep, Mark Hamill, Bruce Lee, and Tom Hanks; architect Julia "Butterfly" Hill; classical conductor Calvin Simmons; rappers MC Hammer, 2Pac, Messy Marv, and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciencesOakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long historyFor many visitors, the first place they are likely to visit is Downtown, especially if they are in town on business, or simply do not know where to startThe center of transportation by BART and by bus is there, if one wants to branch outAnd it is as simple as walking in a direction from there, for the first few neighborhoods, since Old Oakland is along 10th Street, just west of BroadwayJust east of Broadway and continuing north and south is Oakland's famous Chinatown, and that to get the real essence of "Chinatown," Oakland rather than San Francisco is your best betMany of the buildings and streets of Chinatown reflect the diverse nature of its history, in architecture and in the bilingual signs seen throughout the neighborhoodThe curious traveler can venture to take a bus southwards along Broadway, and come to Jack London SquareThe unlikely mixture of warehouses and very expensive restaurants and posh atmosphere alongside some of the landmarks of the city's waterfront makes the Square an interesting place to visit and explore, even for localsIt's the home of the USS Potomac and the site of the namesake author's residence, still preserved and humbly standing not far from a saloon from the same eraJust west of Downtown and slightly north of the Financial District is UptownIn the evening it buzzes with art galleries, theaters and residents and Bay Area visitors coming into the area to see concertsA popular area on the weekend with a mixed vibe of hipster and hip hopIt's a burgeoning neighborhood of performing arts ranging from nightclubs to music halls, avant-garde performance art, and even an improv theater companyUptown also has some of the best in the city's vintage architecture, like the Gothic Revival Cathedral Building and the Art Deco Fox and Paramount Theaters, as well as several restaurantsNorth Oakland is a sweeping term, referring to just about everywhere north of Uptown and Lake MerrittMany of the neighborhoods are commercial centers and absolute heaven for foodies or those who seek quieter surroundings than the hustle and bustle of Downtown and ChinatownTemescal is a neighborhood that lies north-northwest from Downtown, centered along the reach of Telegraph Avenue, at and near 51st StreetUntil the 1960s, a dominantly Italian-American neighborhood, it is now a much more diversified neighborhood, home to many restaurants, including some of the city's best Korean and Ethiopian establishmentsNortheast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies Rockridge, a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibesIt has lots of local boutiques and a diverse range of food at all prices and stylesOpen-air markets, bookstores, and a BART station all its own make Rockridge another of many pleasant stops in North OaklandSouth of Rockridge, and southeast of Temescal lies Piedmont Avenue, a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill (Pill Hill) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills, houses and treesAnother of North Oakland's group of foodie spots, home to the city's single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others; cafes, ice cream, coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhoodEast along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocksGrand Lake and Lakeshore both share a friendly, suburban sort of feelThe Grand Lake Theater stands at the entrance to the neighborhood that bears its name, a matter of a few hundred feet from Lakeshore Avenue – both are diverse neighborhoods no matter what your budget, be it burgers or sandwiches or a full romantic evening, either of these twin-sister neighborhoods will make a pleasant time, by day or nightWest Oakland was once a burgeoning working-class neighborhood with its roots tracing as far back as the opening decades of the 19th centuryIt has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent pastStrangely, twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakesAfter the 1906 earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated there, and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousandsWith Loma Prieta in 1989, the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed, and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhood's original Victorian houses, and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhoodThough there are a few draws for the traveler, West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation 
Vava’u is a group of more than 50 islands in Tonga, about 150 miles north of TongatapuThey are either raised coral limestone or coral atollsThe beautiful harbour opposite the main town of Neiafu (known as the Port of Refuge Harbour) is a common destination for yachties sailing the South PacificThe waters of the islands are known for their clarity, it being said that you can see the bottom at 40 metresThe area attracts many humpback whales between June and November and there are lots of companies organising tours to see themThere are numerous places to stay to suit most budgetsUnderstand Findings of Lapita pottery suggest that early-Polynesians were on these islands close to 3000 years agoThese days there are around 20000 people living in the GroupNeiafu and surrounding villages are home to about a third of the Group’s overall population of around 20000, with the majority of the population living in small villages on the other islandsNeiafu is the official port of entry for yachts coming to Vava'u, which attracts over 500 yachts every winter sailing season between June and OctoberA string of islands and reefs along the eastern edge of the Group shelters the area from strong winds and ocean swellS and humpback whales come to these protected waters to give birthThis is the high season for tourism; between December and April few people visit and many tour companies and restaurants close downNeiafu town is the centre of activityIt is on the southern point of the main island of Utu Vava'u and has an attractive setting on one of the world's most beautiful harboursNeiafu offers all the usual amenities including banks, schools, tour companies, restaurants, cafes and bars, supermarkets, a market and a hospitalIt doesn't have a beach but boats to one of the nearby coral atolls with superb sandy beaches are easily availableClimate Vava'u has a tropical climate with average temperatures up to 29 ºC in January and down to 24º C in JuneIt is sunny throughout the yearBetween November and April, it is more humid and thunderstorms and cyclones do occurFrom May to September there are southeast trade winds but during the summer months the winds are from the northeastPort of Refuge Harbor at Neiafu Orientation The main islands are: Utu Vava'uThis is the largest island, where Neiafu is foundIt is a limestone island with heights up to 213 m in the westThe island provides a home to eleven indigenous bird species and contains Mt. Talau national park, with some of the limited remaining native vegetationTropical vegetation includes the pandanus or screw pine, the casuarina, and the mulberry tree, the bark of which is used to make tapa clothPangaimotuThis is the second largest island in the GroupIt can be seen across the water from Neiafu and is connected by land bridge at the most southern point of ‘Utu Vava’uThere are some good beaches and plenty of secluded cove beaches and protected bays with good snorkellingAvai'o'vuna Swamp is a small coastal wetland on the islandHunga IslandThis is some 35 minutes from Neiafu Harbour and provides the main concentration of humpback whalesThe island lies in deep water and has sheltered waters and bays which provide a resting place for humpbacks with calves 
How to Grow Beavertail Cactus The Beavertail Cactus (Opunitia basilares), found primarily in the Mojave Desert and northwest Mexico; can grow to be about 24 inches (60 cm) high; has pads that look like beavertails; and yields red or purple flowers from spring to early summerGrowing Beavertail can be done at any time of year by scattering seeds in a shady bed or, for faster results, planting cuttings in a mix of soil and sand and ensuring that they have a bit of water and plenty of sunRead the following steps to find out how to grow Beavertail cactusMethod 1 of 2: From Seeds Purchase Beavertail cactus seedsThese can be bought at garden centers or purchased onlineScatter the seedsIn a shady garden bed, simply scatter the seeds on the soilThere's no need to cover them, unless you want to use netting to keep the birds offKeep the soil moist until the seeds germinateMake sure that the garden bed is in the shadeBeavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow, whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlightBe aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cuttingIt can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowersMethod 2 of 2: From Cuttings Obtain Beavertail cuttingsYou can purchase them online or at a local garden centerIf you already own a Beavertail cactus, you can make your own cuttingsTo do this, choose pads (the flat, oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the baseIn order to form a callous and prevent rot, cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry, dark place for 10 to 14 daysPlant the cuttingsPrepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with itMake sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainageSet the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch (2.5 cm.) deepIf you plant the cuttings too deep, they might rotPut some rocks around the pad to anchor it in placeChoose a spot for your Beavertail cactus cuttingsIf you live in an area with strong summer sun, position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and southThis will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the dayMake sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter windsWait for a monthDo not water the cutting for the first monthThe moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to growToo much water might cause rotAfter 1 month, roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first timeAlways let the soil dry before you water the cuttingsOnce fully rooted, they are extremely drought resistantFertilize the plantsDuring the spring, summer, and fall, the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizerLet the cuttings growFrom the first pad, many more will formThe second or third pad will bear some flowers, but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests 
How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally Having mice in your home is both a nuisance and a health hazard. They can cause property damage, create a mess, and produce unpleasant smellsIn addition, repelling and removing rodents from your home can be a hassle if you don't know what you are doingIt can also be dangerous if you use toxic chemicals and poisonsIt's a good thing, then, that there are some simple ways to effectively get mice out of your home without the use of toxic chemicals and poisonsMethod 1 Discouraging Mice Naturally Keep your home cleanMany times mice are drawn into homes on the search for foodIf there is nothing to eat, mice will be less likely to stayKeep all food stored properly in airtight containers or in places that are safe from mouse attack. [1] Apply peppermint oilPeppermint oil is a natural deterrentThe smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near itIt also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaningIt also gives the house a lovely smell, and is not toxic, unlike many synthetic chemical treatmentsYou can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores.
