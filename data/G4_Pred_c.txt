A collaborative pilot project involving Claire Bailey-Ross from the University of Portsmouth and Andrew Beresford from Durham University has used eye-tracking technology to determine how viewers experience art, and how their experience can be impacted by elements such as written interpretation. The study, which focused on a unique collection of 17th-century Zurbarán paintings located at Auckland Castle, provided insights into the unconscious processes involved when viewing artworks. The results are expected to have implications for future museum and gallery practices.
Researchers have developed a web crawler to automatically gather data on university faculty members across the academic spectrum. The system can rapidly compile a full and continually updated census of an academic field, and boasts the ability to assemble a faculty census in several hours instead of the 1,600 required to do so manually. This research tool will aid in understanding the diversity and career trajectories of the scientific workforce without relying on surveys and services such as Google Scholar, or relying on the aggregate reports of organizations like the Computing Research Association (CRA).

A study has revealed experiences of discrimination among a broad, representative selection of adults living in the United States. Participants were asked about perceived discrimination and the reasons for it, including race, gender, age, religion, weight, sexual orientation, education or income level, and physical disability. The data was weighted per the Add Health survey system, ensuring the findings can be taken as nationally representative.

The New Institutional Economics approach to economics, championed by Nobel Prize laureates such as Douglass North, centers on the concepts of transaction costs and institutions, arguing that economic transactions involve costs, and if these costs exceed gains, exchanges will not occur. This approach emphasizes inclusive institutions that include solid property rights, an impartial legal system and equality-based society and warns of the dangers of states who exhibit predatory behavior, which inhibits transactions and negatively impacts economic performance. An application of these theories to the Argentine State shows a history of governments with predatory behavior and unstable politics, reflecting an extractive institutional framework where property rights are not respected, leading to negative economic outcomes.
The Gújjolaay Eegimaa is a Jóola language, spoken mainly in the Mof-Ávvi region of southern Senegal by an estimated population of between 7,000 and 11,200 people. It's spoken alongside several other local languages with different names, with which it shares many similarities. However, the Gújjolaay Eegimaa language is currently endangered, with declining transmission to younger generations, necessitating an understanding of its cultural context amid other languages and local communities.

Pablo Ruiz Fabo and a team of researchers have developed software that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify instances of enjambment in Spanish poetry. The large-scale study involved the analysis of approximately 3,750 sonnets by around 1,000 authors from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Enjambment, a literary device where a sentence, phrase, or thought does not end with the line of poetry but instead continues to the next one, has been extensively studied in specific cases, but this is the first time software has analyzed it across numerous works and time periods.

The proliferation of deceptive or predatory publications intend to mimic legitimate expertise, a phenomenon referred to as "epistemic pollution", is reducing public trust in expert authority and making it harder to differentiate dependable sources from unreliable ones. Examples include the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds), a small, socially conservative group of doctors whose politically-charged viewpoints have been mistaken as the consensus of the larger pediatric profession, and publishing giant Elsevier's collaboration with pharmaceutical companies to produce faux peer-reviewed journals promoting their products. Additionally, questionable behavior from institutional publishers such as the Frontiers journals, who are known to publish controversial articles, along with the rise of "pay-to-publish" predatory publications, further exemplify this epistemic pollution, challenging the credibility of academic research.

Research into adult-learned second language (L2) has found that despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar, adult learners can achieve, and crucially retain, near-native levels of use and neurocognitive processing, even without continual practice or exposure to the L2. However, a substantial period of no exposure, which can often occur in classroom-like or immersion-like contexts, can often lead to decreases in proficiency and less native-like neural processes, a phenomena often referred to as “use it or lose it”. Different outcomes based on the type of L2 training suggests that periods without exposure generally lead to attrition (loss) of L2 performance, although some studies suggest attrition levels off after the first few years and higher levels of proficiency can result in less attrition or none at all; in some cases, gains in performance were observed.
A study conducted by the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin in Brazil suggests that using cognitive digital games in schools can improve a range of learning and cognitive skills, including sustaining attention, visual skills, memory, and problem-solving, particularly as classroom distractions increase. The 5-week trial used a platform called Escola do Cérebro, which integrates seven games into a database, allowing student performance to be monitored by teachers. The results, from a sample of 71 students aged 7 and 9, showed significant improvements in sustained attention and problem-solving skills.
A study examining 10 spoken languages across five continents suggests that the utterance "Huh?" is a universal word. The researchers argue that "Huh?" satisfies the definition of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign that must be learned and is used as part of "other-initiated repair (OIR)," a sequence where there is a problem in conversation and the listener signals the speaker to repeat or clarify. Despite linguistic science asserting that the connection between a word's meaning and its sound is arbitrary, and thus words across different languages should sound distinct, "Huh?" appears to be an anomaly with its form and function highly similar across languages.
The study explores the semantic and pragmatic understanding, known as SI (Scalar Implicature) interpretations, of Chitonga-speaking children over the age of six, and postulates they would have adult-like SI interpretations. It found that the use of a training session and a specific question format guided participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity rather than providing truth value judgments. The findings suggest that the acquisition of pragmatic inference follows the order previously identified in research, but seems to be completed at a later age for speakers of Chitonga, a Bantu language. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings and further explore potential cultural or experiential factors impacting the development of SI interpretations.

The National Library of the Netherlands and Amsterdam's Vrije Universiteit have launched a series of Digital Humanities Clinics aimed at educating librarians about digital humanities (DH). The clinics aim to provide basic DH methodological and technical skills to those librarians wanting to assist researchers and students in the field, and to mitigate a lack of knowledge and skills in the library sector. By prioritising collaboration with academia, the clinics' ultimate goal is to create a more supportive environment for new digital scholars in Dutch universities.

Researchers at the Bataan Peninsula State University in the Philippines have developed a way to convert harmful Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) bulbs into safe and energy-efficient Segmented Compact Light-emitting Diode (SCLED) bulbs. CFL bulbs, a common household item, contain mercury and emit ultraviolet (UV) radiation, raising environmental and health concerns. The new development not only addresses these issues, but also helps to conserve energy, making the SCLED a more sustainable and lower-cost lighting solution.

Suilen H. Alvarado proposes new mutation operators designed to test Geographic Information Systems (GIS). These operators, based on an analysis of typical programming errors, are created to artificially introduce faults and generate different mutants or versions of the system under test to ensure its correctness. Used on two real-world GIS applications, these mutation operators provide a proof of concept of their effectiveness.
The article highlights the importance of replication studies in second language (L2) research and the role of platforms like the Instruments for Research into Second Languages (IRIS) repository and the Open Science Framework in supporting such endeavors. Despite more than 50 calls for replication in L2 studies, there is a perceived shortage of such studies thus far, possibly due to a perceived lack of prestige and originality, which has subsequently led to concerns regarding the amount and quality of such research. The authors stress on the need to bridge this gap through narrative and systematic reviews, and encourage future replication work with a set of recommendations, arguing that testing the reproducibility of findings is crucial for the refinement of theory within this field.
The European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have launched satellites enabled with remotes to track salinity levels in the ocean, a parameter key to understanding climate change and ocean dynamics. However, challenges persist in remotely sensing sea surface salinity (SSS) due to external factors such as sea surface roughness and foam effects, which alter sensor-measured brightness levels, and atmospheric interferences. Moreover, measuring SSS in offshore areas of China is disrupted by radio frequency interference (RFI), which results in large volumes of data being discarded.
A study has demonstrated that the use of an artificial tail alters the movement and posture of chickens in ways similar to non-avian dinosaurs. The more vertically-oriented femur in these chickens resembled the hip-driven locomotion in crocodilians, mammals and, possibly, bipedal non-avian dinosaurs, regardless of the extra weight. Therefore, the position of the CoM (Center of Mass) can significantly impact limb posture and how legs move.

A discourse analysis study, involving online conversations of Game of Thrones fans, is being used to define a 'transmedia fan', a person who consumes media across different platforms. The term was originally used by Marsha Kinder and popularized by Henry Jenkins.

His career took off after the successful reception of his Slavonic Dances, Op. 46 in 1878, and continued with his first religious piece, Stabat Mater, which gained popularity in both the UK and the U.S. Notably, Johannes Brahms, an influential German composer, endorsed Dvořák early in his career, and later Dvořák made his mark on America, writing his two most successful orchestral works - the Symphony From the New World and his Cello Concerto, while serving as a director at the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City.

Emperor Norton Joshua Abraham Norton was a citizen of San Francisco who made a dramatic claim in 1859 to be "Norton I, Emperor of the United States" and later added "Protector of Mexico" to his self-given titles. Despite having no political power, Norton issued various proclamations including orders for the United States Congress to dissolve and calls for the building of a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland and a corresponding tunnel, ideas which came to fruition long after his death. Norton's eccentric reign, which was largely humorously indulged by his local community, has inspired several characters in literature and led to campaigns to rename the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge after him.
Pierre Charles L'Enfant, also known as Peter Charles L'Enfant, was a French-born American military engineer who developed the basic plan for Washington, D.C., commonly known as the L'Enfant Plan. L'Enfant, who was born in Paris in 1754 and moved to America in 1777, worked with General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War and also designed the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati, a society of former Continental Army officers.

Jonathan M. Stan, one of the owners of the Pacific Standard bar in Brooklyn, New York, spoke with Wikinews about the creation of the bar’s new cocktail named Santorum. The drink was inspired by a controversial definition of Santorum developed by columnist Dan Savage in response to former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum’s statements about homosexuality. The cocktail, made up of an orange citrus vodka variety, Baileys Irish Cream, Godiva chocolate flakes, and Angostura bitters, will be available "until he's irrelevant".
During an interview with meteorologists about Cyclone Phailin, the experts agreed that cyclones begin to lose strength as they move over land as they are cut off from their energy source: the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface. The forecast stated that the Category 3 cyclone would decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours; however, heavy rains, landslides and flooding were still expected. When asked about the preparedness of the Indian Government, meteorologist David Titley indicated that from reports he has seen, the government appeared to be well prepared, coordinating mass evacuations and taking proactive steps.
Marymegan Daly and Frank Rack have been working on identifying a new species of sea anemone found in Antarctica, named Edwardsiella andrillae. The anemone was found under the ice in the Ross Sea, and the researchers hope they can return in 2015 to collect more specimen. This discovery could lead to new knowledge about how the anemones survive in such cold conditions, possibly due to certain antifreeze chemicals, but further research is needed to be certain.

In 2013, Wikinews interviewed Simon Ličen, assistant professor at Washington State University, about U.S. attitudes towards the Paralympics. Ličen posited that American society often overlooks athletes with disabilities due to existing power dynamics, as sports in the U.S. largely emphasize consumerism and success based on merit, thus reinforcing stereotypes related to gender, ethnicity, and nationality. He also discussed the potential impact of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, being televised live in the U.S. for the first time, suggesting that the way NBC would mediate the event could impact public perceptions towards athletes with disabilities.

LibriVox, a website where volunteers narrate public domain books to make them accessible to people worldwide for free, was created to support a vibrant public domain, according to founder Hugh McGuire.

The Onion, a satirical news outlet, in an exclusive interview, revealed their unique creative process. They start with around 600-800 headline jokes, whittle those down to 15-20, then assign them to specific writers based on their strengths who then develop the full concept. The Onion team emphasizes that, different from conventional methods used by outlets like The New York Times, their work environment is comparable to wine tasting - quiet and contemplative rather than full of continuous laughter.

The future of the peace process in Israel is inevitably peace, according to Shimon Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel. However, he questions how long the process will take and how many victims it will claim.

Israeli mathematician and writer Aner Shalev, currently a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Einstein Institute of Mathematics, spoke at a conference in Levico Terme, Trento, Italy on philosophy and representation theory to resolve conjectures in the asymptotic groups theory. In an interveiw with Wikinews, Shalev spoke about his love for mathematics for its beauty, freedom, and creativity, and his belief that a reason many students dislike mathematics is due to bad teaching and difficulties in understanding the precise nature of the subject. He also spoke on his career as a writer, stating that he began writing by documenting his dreams, and describing his experimental style of writing, such as using musical structures and alternating narratives.

NASA's Stardust, a space capsule that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild 2, is part of the first US "sample return" mission since Apollo and the first ever from beyond the moon. The Stardust @ home project, directed by Andrew Westphal, engages in an online collaborative effort to discover the microscopic samples collected by the capsule. This project relies solely on human intelligence to examine digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array and find the tracks of interstellar dust particles, which will help in yielding the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium.

The Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia has found that almost half of all Australian primary school children suffer from mild to moderately severe iodine deficiency. Iodine is crucial for growth and mental development, and deficiency can lead to issues like growth retardation, brain damage, and deafness. Professor Cres Eastman, chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, has called for all edible salt in Australia to be iodised, similar to practices in the USA and most of Europe, and authorities, including Food Standards Australia New Zealand, are considering proposed guidelines for mandatory iodisation.

North Korea's military has been put into a "quasi-state of war", following the exchange of artillery fire with South Korea.

A new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Colorado State University, and the University of Sheffield has warned that by 2050, global crop yields could reduce by more than 10% due to global warming and ozone pollution, significantly impacting food security. The scientists found that depending on the region and crop, yields may be primarily sensitive to ozone, as is the case with wheat, or heat, as is the case with maize. Co-author Colette Heald emphasised the importance of improving air quality and reducing pollution to improve crop yields, the study was supported by the Croucher Foundation.

A Greek court has ruled that those who follow the ancient Greek religion can now legally worship at archeological sites, reversing a former ban imposed by the Greek Ministry of Culture. The Greek Orthodox Church, a significant Christian denomination, has criticised these worshippers of ancient Greek deities, differing in their estimate of believers to be around 40,000 rather than the suggested 100,000. This ruling comes as a significant development for neo-pagan religions such as Wicca, as well as Hellenic polytheism that focus specifically on ancient traditions and gods.

Bobby Flay's success on his TV show, "Beat Bobby Flay", may not be due to the show being rigged but rather a result of selective casting by the producers. Potential challengers are asked about their signature dishes in the audition process, with the producers favoring chefs whose dishes fall within Flay's areas of expertise. This theory is supported by the occurrence of celebrity chefs winning more frequently against Flay, due to their freedom to choose any dish, as compared to the less commendable outcomes when average chefs contest against the Iron Chef.

A device repair and technical support specialist was called out after hours to help a business owner transfer "important data" to her new phone.

The narrator and his wife witnessed a lady loudly discussing her credit card details over the phone in a public restaurant, Panera, which shocked them due to the potential security risk. The narrator emphasized the need to safeguard personal information in public spaces, while also drawing attention to similar carelessness from people during his tenure at a call center. He touched upon how people often prioritized convenience over security, with grievances arising when their information was unsafe or inaccessible, and criticized companies, such as Capital One and Equifax, for not prioritizing better security.

In a Reddit thread discussing conspiracy theories, one user hypothesizes that cellphones possibly listen for key words to deliver targeted ads. This is based on instances where ads on a user's Facebook feed directly correlated with recent spoken conversations, for example, discussing a specific model of a standing desk or mentioning hard boiled eggs and subsequently seeing related ads. The thread also touched on the mysterious death of Natacha Jaitt, a journalist who exposed a pedophile ring and suspiciously died soon after, and a theory that Tyrannosaurus Rex skeletons might have feathers and wings, not the typically depicted small, stubby arms.
Escape The Room Employees shared two remarkable stories they encountered: first, an 8-year-old bespectacled boy wearing a NASA shirt whose interests and instincts were consistently dismissed by his unconcerned parents in finding clues during the game; second, a persistent young man who planned to make his proposal inside the game room but ended up asking his girlfriend to go with him to prom instead. The parents' dismissal of their son's inputs led to many missed clues, while the unexpected "promposal" left a memorable impression on the staff despite the girlfriend declining the prom invitation.

The article suggests that while gender norms in society are useful and practical in our mostly cisgender society, people should be respectful if someone corrects their assumption about their gender. It argues that we should stick with the binary gender assumption norms that most people are comfortable with, and accommodate those who identify otherwise in the same way society provides for disabilities and allergies. However, the piece also asserts it is important for people to be aware that their assumptions may be incorrect and to be tolerant and understanding if they are corrected.

The article discusses the complaints introverts on Reddit have about extroverts' behaviour, particularly the push for introverts to act extroverted.

However, they also defended their ability to have good social skills and meaningful relationships, disagreeing with the commonly held belief that introverts struggle in such areas.

Countries are in debt because they borrow money from their own people and from other countries. This is possible because the money that is printed is technically a debt that the Federal Reserve owes to the bearer of the note. When a country prints more money, it devalues the rest of the currency in circulation, which can lead to inflation and economic instability, as seen in Zimbabwe. Therefore, it's important for currency to have value and stability, which is why we've transitioned to a fiat currency system where the government declares paper money to have value.
The article speculates that in the "Monsters, Inc." universe, Monstropolis might be the only city in a world devastated by an undisclosed catastrophe. It suggests there might not be any other companies combating the energy crisis, while indications that the city cannot be easily left could suggest a hostile or even apocalyptic environment. It also explores the plot detail of Boo, a human child, being the first to enter the Monster World, and questions whether there could be links between the Monster and Human worlds not yet revealed.
Humans are the only species known to intentionally limit their reproduction, a phenomenon potentially linked to the labor and resource intensity of raising human offspring. However, various animal species exhibit certain behaviors under specific circumstances that result in lowered reproduction, for example, White tail deer slow reproduction in poor food conditions. Reports of pandas struggling with reproduction in captivity were also mentioned, but the challenge appears to be more related to the captivity conditions than the species' reproductive tendencies.

The article discusses the usage of polygraph and Deception Detection Devices (DDD) during recruitment processes, noting that these tools observe involuntary responses in the body which can indicate stress or fear rather than pinpointing lies directly. Through an example scenario, it is suggested that while both tools can identify moments of stress during an interviewer’s question, they don't necessarily indicate deception, as the stress could be due to factors unrelated to lying about the question at hand. For instance, the character Joe gets worried when asked about engaging a prostitute not because he did, but because of a past encounter where he was propositioned by a prostitute.
The article is a discussion on how Americans perceive race and racial issues, and how European countries interpret America's seemingly strong emphasis on race. Key points of discussion include the understanding and awareness of events in America's racial history, such as slavery, the KKK, Civil Rights Movement, and the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement. The author recognizes that the subject of race is complex, especially as it impacts the process of applications like college enrollment and affirmative action, and the recognition of America's wealth and power partly owing to geographic advantages.
The post explains the concept of "ring" in a singing voice, suggesting it to be an operatic technique poorly understood by novice singers. As an alternative to obsessing over achieving this sound, the person replying advises focusing on developing a consistent, pleasant voice in line with the style of music the singer wishes to pursue. If they wish to achieve the "ring", associated often with opera singers like Josh Groban, they are advised to do exercises focused on creating a clear buzzing sensation while humming, ensuring tonal consistency when transitioning from humming to open-mouth singing.
Graduate students, especially introverted ones, expressed the challenges with feeling obligated to attend social events such as club meetings, BBQs, and happy hours as part of their PhD programs. Some argued that attending such events provides networking opportunities, the chance to be recommended for awards and jobs, and to build good relationships with faculty and peers. However, others asserted that it's not necessary to attend all events and it's important to find a balance that suits one's personality and comfort level without feeling guilty, although it was agreed that graduate school can be isolating and some social interaction is beneficial.
The post asserts that all information available about space and space travel is fake or misleading. The author suggests skepticism towards NASA and Hollywood, claiming simulated space experiences, anomalies in images, and inconsistencies in astronaut behavior as evidence for widespread deception. The post concludes by asserting that the belief in a spherical Earth and space exploration in general may be likened to faith in a religion due to the lack of firsthand human experience.

During a dinner with his wife's new boss, a man was presented with an undercooked steak that he did not want to eat. In an impulsive attempt to dispose of the steak, he tried to throw it out a window that he mistakenly thought was open, only to have the meat slide down the glass, leaving a noticeable trail of juice. Both his wife and her boss were left confounded and disgusted as he unsuccessfully tried to cover up his blunder, and in the end, managed to eat the entire raw steak.
Stroke survivors have shared their experiences of the period after a stroke, describing their state of awareness and communication difficulties during recovery. They noted their initial confusion and disorientation, diminished ability to participate in conversation, and the gradual process of regaining mobility and communication skills.

In mid-2015, Snyder presented his original, three-hour version of the film to studio executives at WB, the studio producing the film. However, the studio management, who should have been part of the production process from the scripting stages, decided that a three-hour film was not appealing to audiences, who want to be entertained and see more actions throughout the movie, not just in the last act. They chose to release a shorter cut of the film instead of the original UE, which, while it may have resulted in fewer showings, would have been a more respected film, despite its uneven action sequences.

The United Nations (UN) remains fundamental in brokering global issues such as humanitarian crises, ecological disasters and political developments, including the Arab Spring, and defining a cogent and collaborative counter-terrorism strategy. Austria plays a significant role in supporting these efforts through condemning human rights violations in conflict areas, supplying humanitarian aid to places like Libya, and offering mediating platforms for dialogue between nations such as Sudan and South Sudan. Additionally, Austria underscores the importance of sustainable development, particularly around energy, and has taken the decision to reject the use of nuclear energy following the Fukushima disaster.

In Taiwan, over 2,000 citizens have installed sensors in their homes and schools to monitor air quality, contributing to a crowdsourced environmental agency project. The sensor data is uploaded to a public cloud and then to a distributed ledger, ensuring the numbers can't be changed, providing reliable data for environmental monitoring. The Taiwan government supports this initiative as part of their digitization and civic engagement efforts, manufacturing inexpensive, precise sensors for the community, and placing them in remote areas to bridge the digital divide.

Senators, in their trial of the impeachment of President Trump, have been implored to adhere to their oath of impartiality. However, despite acknowledging that President Trump was wrong to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for interference in US elections, many Republican Senators have announced their intended vote against the articles of impeachment. The discourse holds that these Senators choosing party loyalty over national duty muddies America's commitment to be a republic of laws, not political parties.

The inaugural address acknowledges the significant ceremony of the orderly transfer of authority and thanks the previous office for their service. The speaker, without explicitly identified in this excerpt, addresses the economic challenges of inflation, unemployment, and a tax system penalizing achievements and the decades of deficit while emphasizing the need for collective action for preserving the future. He suggests the economic crisis is due to the government being the problem rather than the solution, and calls for unity and equitable solutions for the everyone, including those from all professions as well as Senator Hatfield, Vice President Bush, and Vice President Mondale.

He referenced ISIS in relation to this, stating that Islamic terrorism is gaining alarming momentum in the Middle East, while the US appears to lack a strategic response. Trump also criticized immigration policies, specifically pointing out issues with immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American nations.

The Texas War for Independence was fueled by American settlers in Texas, who held a deep resentment against the Mexican government for various reasons, such as restrictions on practicing their Protestant religion, the Mexican legal system, the limited representation in the state legislature, and notably the abolition of slavery in 1829. The tension escalated into a rebellion which was temporarily quelled when the Mexican President, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, made concessions to their demands, excluding statehood. However, Santa Anna later reneged on these rights, triggering the full-blown Texas War for Independence characterized by key events like the Fall of the Alamo and culminating in the formal declaration of Texas's independence from Mexico in March 1836.
The act of winking, though physically similar to the automatic blinking common to all humans, carries loaded social meaning, especially in American culture, where it often signifies humor or playfulness. This difference is highlighted by cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz as an example of how culture heavily involves learned, rather than innate behaviors. In other words, practices like winking, carrying culturally-specific meanings and requiring explicit instruction, signify the shared understanding and behaviors that define a particular culture.

The Chinese tradition of artistic excellence places less emphasis on 'mei' or beauty, instead valuing harmony, tranquility, clarity, antiquity, and subtlety. This is exemplified in the aesthetics of guqin (Chinese zither) music, which places beauty as tenth in its list of 24 aesthetic categories. The shift of focus from appearance to experience in both Western and Chinese art traditions reflects a greater consideration for what makes art meaningful or valuable, rather than simply what makes it beautiful.
In ancient Greece, philosophers such as Leucippus and Democritus posited that all matter was composed of small, finite "atomos" or atoms, an idea later overshadowed by Aristotle's belief that matter was comprised of the elements fire, earth, air, and water. Approximately two millennia later, English schoolteacher John Dalton established Dalton's atomic theory, which proposed that matter was constructed of small atoms, that each element was made of a unique type of atom with a characteristic mass, that these atoms differed from those of all other elements, that compounds were made of atoms from multiple elements combined in a small, whole-number ratio, and that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during chemical change. Dalton's atomic theory, first proposed in 1807, still forms an integral part of modern atomic theory.

Cognition is the process of thinking, including aspects such as perception, knowledge, problem-solving, judgement, language, and memory. Cognitive psychology aims to understand and explain these processes, studying elements like human thinking, emotion, creativity, language, problem solving and various cognitive processes.

Evolutionary ethics is related to the concept of moral facts and how morality has evolved within human beings. Philosophers like Michael Ruse argue that our sense of morality is influenced by evolutionary forces, creating an illusion of morality's objectivity and suggesting there may be no moral facts. Critics, however, contend that evolutionary explanations of morality do not necessarily negate the existence of moral facts and moral realism.

The United States is a representative democracy, meaning political power rests with the people who elect representatives to pass laws on their behalf, including Congress, the president, vice president, state legislators, governors, and local officials. Decisions are typically made based on majority rule, though minority rights are also protected to ensure individuals can't be deprived of certain rights, even if a larger number oppose them. However, elements of direct democracy do exist in the U.S., where citizens may vote directly on specific issues or laws.
The article discusses the role of motivation in learning, specifically exploring the concepts of resilience and grit.

The first humans migrated to the Americas around 9,000 to 15,000 years ago using a land bridge known as Beringia that connected Asia and North America. These immigrants included the Olmec civilization, which developed in Mesoamerica and developed notable works of art, architecture, pottery, and sculpture, and the Maya civilization, which developed an advanced mathematical and written language system, as well as landmarks like the city-states of Copan, Tikal, and Chichen Itza. Both cultures traced their roots back to migrants who traveled across Beringia.
Adam Smith pointed out that the division of labor allows businesses and workers to produce a larger quantity of goods. Three reasons for this increased productivity are worker specialization, enhanced efficiency and quality from repetition of tasks, and economies of scale, where the average cost of producing each unit declines as the level of production increases. With the division and specialization of labor, society can produce and consume far more than if everyone tried to produce all of their own goods and services.

Ethnocentrism is the belief that one's own culture is superior to all others, often leading to a negative or dismissive attitude towards differing cultural practices or norms. This mentality can lead to conflict or misunderstanding and has historically fueled harmful practices such as cultural imperialism. On the other hand, cultural relativism is the practice of assessing a culture by its own standards rather than one's own, requiring an open mind and a willingness to consider different values and norms; however, this can sometimes lead to xenocentrism, an absolute acceptance and belief in the superiority of another culture over one's own.
Einstein’s view of gravity differs from Newton’s concept of the gravitational force in that Einstein believed gravity was a warping of spacetime in the presence of large masses. Rather than light being directly affected by gravity, Einstein proposed that light and all things that travel through space-time have their paths altered by this warping effect. Therefore, the path light follows may not always be a straight line - a significant departure from Newton's viewpoint.
This article describes the concepts of quartiles and percentiles, two measures of location in data sets, and how they are useful in analysis and comparisons.

Once rooted, the Beavertail Cactus becomes extremely drought resistant and will benefit from fertilization during the growth periods of spring, summer, and fall.
Biologists believe that hypnotizing a chicken, a trick known to many farm residents, is a stress response which simulates playing dead as a defense against predators. The hypnotic effect can be achieved by holding the chicken down, putting one finger in front of its beak and moving it back and forth until the chicken stops moving, alternatively a line can be drawn using a stick, chalk or one's finger slowly outward from the beak. However, there may be a stress component to this state largely identified by abnormal feathering, continuous preening, or delayed egg-laying; therefore, the time period in such a state should be kept short and infrequent to prevent health problems.
