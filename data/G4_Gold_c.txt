A collaborative pilot project involving researchers from the University of Portsmouth and Durham University used eye-tracking techniques to investigate how aesthetic appreciation influences the way viewers experience Spanish art, specifically focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings. The study, believed to be the first of its kind to investigate how collections or devotional themes are appreciated aesthetically, used eye-tracking to gain insight into unconscious visual behaviours in art appreciation, as well as the impact of museum labels on visual exploration of artworks. The findings may provide new insights into visual processing in arts and culture and have important implications for museum and gallery practices.

A novel system, utilising a topical web crawler, can accumulate a comprehensive census of any academic field quickly and efficiently, using publicly available information on the internet. The system can gather census data in just a few hours, a significant improvement over the approximately 1,600 hours required to manually collate data. This system will allow new research on the composition of academic sectors, for instance, computer science, providing complete faculty listings, potentially able to track changes over time and evaluate policies intended to broaden participation or improve retention of tenure-track faculty.
This article discusses a study conducted with the aim of estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large and nationally representative sample of adults in the United States. The study also analysed the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences among different racial groups. The results could be used to inform policies aimed at reducing discrimination, as the understanding of its origins and consequences continues to grow.
New Institutional Economics emphasises the importance of property rights and credibility of state commitment to ensure a thriving economy. Transaction costs and institutions are two major principles of this theory; transactions occur only when gains outweigh costs and institutions define economic structure and behaviour. For prosperity, inclusive institutions are necessary which acknowledge and protect private property rights, facilitate an impartial judiciary, and foster an egalitarian society. In contrast, extractive institutions often encourage predatory behaviour which hampers economic performance and political stability. The Argentine state, often exemplifying a predatory government, stands as a case study to this end.
The Gújjolaay Eegimaa or just Eegimaa is an endangered Jóola language spoken in the Basse Casamance area of Southern Senegal by an estimated 7,000 to 11,200 speakers. Spoken mainly in the former kingdom of Mof-Ávvi bordering the Casamance River, it is in potential contact with other languages spoken in neighboring villages. Changes in the population of Eegimaa speakers and its status as an endangered language are significant, as certain cultural practices and ritual names within the community may come from other languages or neighboring communities.
Researchers from France's Lattice Lab and Spain's Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia have developed software for the automatic detection of enjambment in Spanish poetry. Based on natural language processing, the software has been utilised in a large-scale analysis of approximately 3,750 Spanish sonnets from 1,000 authors across four centuries. The application of the software, called "Distant Rhythm", is aimed at facilitating scholarly arguments and explorations around enjambment, a stylistic device where a phrase is split across two lines.
Epistemic pollution, the deliberate misleading of the public by those posing as experts or through the corruption of established sources of expertise, is a problem increasingly affecting public trust in expert authority. This pollution occurs as bad actors take advantage of individuals' reliance on easily recognizable markers of expertise to deceive them, either by setting up mimic institutions appearing to guarantee expertise or through legitimate institutions gaming systems for personal advantage. This erodes the capacity of ordinary people to discern reliable from unreliable sources, often reducing overall trust in expert opinion.
Research on an adult-learned second language (L2) indicates that despite the challenges of acquiring L2, adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing. However, if there are substantial periods of limited exposure or non-use of the language, there may be attrition or loss of proficiency. Some earlier studies have suggested improvements even after a period of limited exposure, attributing such gains to motivation, continued academic training, or general cognitive development.
A recent study conducted by the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina found that cognitive digital games, particularly those focused on problem-solving, significantly improved the attention span of school children. The intervention involved daily use of cognitive digital games on tablets, with different challenges designed to test and improve cognitive skills such as problem-solving ability, working memory, and attention. The results showed a significant improvement in the test group's ability to sustain attention, compared to a control group, according to both student and teacher feedback.
A study has found that the interjection "Huh?" is a universal word used similarly in all languages as a 'repair initiator' when someone has not clearly heard or understood what has been said. The research, which looked at 10 spoken languages from five continents, showed that this specific function of initiating repair in conversation is much greater across languages than chance would suggest. The study also found that "Huh?" meets the criteria of being an actual word, in contrast to previous assumptions that it was a mere grunt or non-lexical sound.

The study hypothesised that children over six years old would have a similar (adult-like) interpretation of scalar implicatures (SI) to adults. The findings were inconclusive due to small sample size and the unique approach to cardinal numbers versus "some" in the Bantu languages studied. Despite limitations in the study such as the need for more participants and potentially better training, the research provides valuable insights into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and highlights the importance of considering language-specific differences and cultural influences on methodology and truth value judgements.
A group of leading Dutch research libraries are developing advanced Training Clinics to teach librarians about Digital Humanities (DH), so that they can support scholars in their respective fields. The National Library of the Netherlands and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - later joined by Leiden University Libraries - have concluded that there is a pressing need for librarians to better understand the quickly advancing area of DH. A curriculum of six full-day clinics will use lectures and hands-on training sessions to provide Dutch librarians with methodological competencies and technical skills in DH.

A study by the Electrical Engineering Department at Bataan Peninsula State University has proposed an innovative solution to the environmental and health risks posed by mercury and UV radiation in Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL). The researchers developed a segmented compact light-emitting diode (SCLED) bulb using busted CFLs, which is efficient, affordable and lacks toxic chemicals. Given the high electrical energy consumption of lighting in households, particularly in the Philippines, this initiative offers a safe and energy-conserving alternative.
The article proposes mutation operators for testing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications. Mutation-based testing, which involves artificially introducing errors into a system to observe behavioural changes, is applied using these new GIS-specific mutation operators and the article outlines how these operators were applied to two real-world applications. The intention is to further extend this mutation-based testing approach to other domains.

Replication studies are crucial in second language (L2) research, as they help validate previous study conclusions and test their reliability and generalizability in different contexts. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of replication studies in L2 research—a discipline where such studies are often dismissed as lacking prestige or originality—this article presents narrative and systematic reviews focusing on the quantity and nature of replication research, the relationship between initial and replication studies, and the interpretation of reproducibility. These reviews are used as an empirical foundation to offer 16 recommendations for future replication work, with the overall aim of improving the quantity and quality of replication studies in L2 research.
The monitoring of global ocean salinity, a crucial marine parameter affecting physical circulations and biogeochemistry dynamics, has improved significantly with the launch of satellites like the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, the Aquarius/SAC-D satellite, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite. These have made sea surface salinity observations from space possible, aiding in understanding ocean dynamics and climate change. However, issues including the sensitivity of satellite measurements, effects of sea surface and atmospheric conditions, and radio frequency interference continue to present challenges, with ongoing research aiming to improve the accuracy of remote sensing in assessing ocean salinity.
Researchers at the University of Chile have concluded that the location of the center of mass (CoM) can be crucial in defining limb posture and locomotion in birds. The team found that adding an artificial tail to chickens produced changes in posture and movement consistent with the patterns inferred for non-avian dinosaurs. The findings could provide valuable insights into the locomotion mechanics and energetics of dinosaurs, as well as understanding the relationship between form and function in dinosaur evolution.

The Game of Thrones franchise, with its multiple media adaptations and global viewership, represents a transmedia system that offers valuable insights for cultural studies and digital humanities. In a study aiming to define the "transmedia fan", a comparative discourse analysis of fan responses to the episode "The Rains of Castamere" was conducted. The research, a first step in understanding the impact of transmedia systems, contributes to the development of further studies on how fans access and manage information in a postdigital society, and poses questions about consumer behavior in relation to transmedia systems like Game of Thrones.

Nick Bos, a biologist from the University of Helsinki, has published a paper which documents ants self-medicating. The team used a common species of ant, Formica fusca, and infected some with a fungus before observing that the infected ants chose food laced with toxic hydrogen peroxide, which reduced the fatality rate by 15%, although healthy ants avoided it. Bos believes that this is first evidence of self-medication in insects, but believes his findings will be supported by further evidence in time.
President of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, William Evans, says that magic is alive as a viable form of entertainment with more magicians working today than ever before, in an interview with Wikinews held in October. Although conceding that the internet has led more young people to develop an interest in magic, he also said it has inhibited the ability of young magicians to think and develop originality because they rely heavily on the internet and do not read enough books. He emphasised the need for magicians to understand the history of magic and what has been done before.

Meteorologists predict that cyclone Phailin will lose strength as it moves over land, having lost its source of energy from the evaporation of warm sea water, and will undergo an increase in friction, which is more severe over land than ocean. However, despite losing strength, the cyclone is expected to cause heavy rainfall, resulting in potential flooding and landslides. While experts can't confirm how prepared the Indian government is for cyclone Phailin, news reports indicate a proactive response including large scale evacuations and coastal area warnings.

In an interview with Wikinews, founder of wikiHow, Jack Herrick, discussed how wikiHow, a wiki-based site providing 'how-to'guides, is growing and aims to eventually provide practical instructions on almost every subject. Herrick explained that before wikiHow, he had run eHow, a website with similar goals, but decided to sell it and use the funds to create wikiHow as it was unable to go into enough detail on every subject while maintaining quality. As the site continues to expand, Herrick hopes to see it become the world’s largest 'how too' manual, and is using a Creative Commons license for the site, which he deems to have been key to its success.

In an interview with Wikinews, Washington State University's Assistant Professor Simon Ličen discussed the US's attitudes towards the Paralympics. Ličen said that Paralympic sports bring attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in US society because people do not want to identify with those who are disabled. He also noted that the effect of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi being televised live in the US for the first time, will depend on a number of aspects including the time at which it is broadcast and the way the event is mediated.
LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire has discussed the platform's origins, saying that he saw it as a way to help maintain a vibrant public domain.

The news satire organization shares around 600 to 800 headline ideas on a weekly basis, with team members creating different drafts and giving the story a visual dimension, before the final product is publicised. The process is largely based on dialogue and collaboration with different writers who have their own areas of expertise such as politics or entertainment.
Shimon Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and key figure in the Israeli peace process, remains committed to the notion that peace is the only viable future for Israel, stating that the problem lies in the unpredictability of when this will be achieved, and how many victims will suffer in the process. He suggests that historical land disputes and subsequent wars are becoming increasingly irrelevant, with a shift in focus from the physical to the scientific, arguing that fear and resistance to modernity serves as the primary obstacle to peace. On the issue of Israel’s regional prominence being overshadowed by the oil wealth of Arab states, Peres asserts that intellectual capital surpasses physical wealth, explaining that brains, not oil, drive wealth creation in the new age.

In 2011, Microsoft announced a campaign to discontinue its 10-year-old Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) and encourages users to update to newer versions of Internet Explorer. From the launch of its aggressive campaign, "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown", Microsoft’s goal was to reduce the number of IE6 users to less than one percent, with the company stating that web standards have advanced and the older version, with its numerous security vulnerabilities, is no longer suited to the demands of modern web technology. Microsoft's overall share of the browser market has decreased from 70% in 2009 to approximately 56% in 2011, largely attributed to the rising popularity of rivals Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

Almost half of all Australian primary school children are suffering from iodine deficiency, according to a study published in the Medical Journal of Australia. Researchers are calling for the “urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia” to rectify the situation, which they argue can lead to mental and growth retardation. The decline in iodine intake is attributed to changes in the dairy industry and a decreased consumption of iodised salt used in foods.

North Korea's military has been placed on high alert in a 'quasi-state of war' after the country exchanged artillery fire with South Korea.

Over 345 Muslim pilgrims were killed in a Hajj stampede near Mecca, Saudi Arabia in a ritual that involves the stoning of Satan at Jamarat Bridge, according to the Saudi Interior Ministry. The deadly stampede was triggered when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall, creating a bottleneck and leading to a wave of people behind them resulting in the fatalities. This significant incident is yet another in a series of past deadly stampedes during the Hajj, the most tragic occurring in 1991 where 1,426 pilgrims were trampled to death.

Catholic schools in Italy are being asked to pay taxes on their properties, after a judgement by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation recognised the legitimacy of the municipality of Livorno to ask the religious schools Santo Spirito and Immacolata to pay more than €422,000 in tax arrears from 2004 to 2009. The new demand amongst local municipalities is being strongly resisted by the Catholic Church and M5S movement; the latter is asking the regional government to assure local administrations that they regulate proper application of the Supreme Court’s sentence. Under the country's new municipal tax system, only those schools demanding fees in excess of the state's fixed mean cost per student will attract tax.

The University of Southern Indiana's art gallery has unveiled an Andy Warhol exhibit showing the artist's Polaroids, gelatin silver prints and screen prints.

If this dish is either already something Bobby is an expert on, or something unique but in an unusual or flawed variation, it is more likely that the contestant will be chosen and also that Bobby will win. The dishes that Bobby prepares are typically straightforward versions of whatever the dish is, ensuring their appeal over an odd or complicated version of the same dish produced by the contestant.

A person offering technical support to local businesses and families recalls an after-hours emergency call to transfer important data from an old phone to a new one for a business owner. Upon arrival, the tech support person discovered that the "important data" was the customer's Candy Crush game progress, needed as a distraction during smoke breaks.

A couple dining in a restaurant overheard a woman loudly discussing her unpaid bills on the phone and revealing her credit card number, expiration date, security code, and zip code in public. The article emphasizes caution about personal information, citing experiences in call centers where customers expect workers to remember or have constant access to their credit card data. The tradeoff between security and convenience is also mentioned, with the point made that often companies prioritize the latter until security issues arise, leading to major data thefts.
The article discusses two main conspiracy theories. Firstly, the author relays their belief that their phone's microphone is constantly listening and targeting advertising based on overheard conversations, citing several instances where ads appeared on their Facebook feed relating to recently spoken about subjects. Secondly, the author explores the theory that Argentinian journalist Natacha Jaitt was murdered by the Catholic Church for publicly exposing a pedophile ring, despite officially dying of suicide, and suggesting that the "arms" on Tyrannosaurus Rex skeletons are actually misinterpreted as being stubby arms instead of resembling wings such as those on an ostrich.

Employees of the "Escape the Room" game recount the strangest stories of their patrons.

The author argues that societal norms, including gender assumptions, are practical and should mostly be maintained due to the vast majority of individuals identifying as either male or female, and appearing as such. They suggest that while it is not necessary to eradicate all gender norms, society should be educated to not tolerate harassment of non-binary or transgender individuals, and graciously accept corrections of gender pronoun usage if necessary. The author believes that for most situations, it is impractical to regularly announce individual gender pronouns, except in certain contexts, such as LGBT or transgender events.
Introverts on Reddit share the pressure they feel from society to mimic extroverted behaviors, particularly in dating and social interactions.

Countries borrow from their own people through issuing debt, equalling the amount of money printed. However, printing more money devalues the currency already in circulation, for example, if the government printed $1 quadrillion dollars in a week, the value of the dollar would likely crash. This is similar to the concept of over-printing collectible cards and devaluing them through oversupply. Before the transition to fiat currency, which is paper that only has value because the government says it does, people used to trade valuable goods like gold directly for goods and services. Now, the value of money is largely theoretical and is underpinned by the trust and stability of the country issuing it.

Monsters, Inc. operates as the sole power provider in a dystopian world, with Monstropolis being the only mentioned city. Its inhabitants are speculated to be unable to venture beyond the city limits due to unknown threats in "The Wild," which is presupposed to be the toxic human world. This theory suggests that Monstropolis may exist within the same planet as humans, but the monsters are too terrified to directly interact with humans to seek alternate energy solutions.
Humans are the only species known to consciously try and stop reproducing, an action believed to be linked to the large labor and resource investment required for raising human offspring. Other animals may exhibit decreased reproductive interest in conditions of high competition or low resources, like Overpopulated rats that lost interest in sex, and certain species of deer and rabbits that will stop or slow reproduction during times of poor food availability. However, the belief that certain animals, like the giant panda, are naturally poor at reproducing is largely a myth, as captivity generally poses challenges for breeding across all species.
The article discusses the use of polygraph devices in the hiring process and explains that these Deception Detection Devices work by measuring involuntary physical responses to fear. The author emphasizes that while polygraphs are not admissible in criminal court due to the potential for false indications of deception, they can still be useful tools for verifying honesty during recruitment. They advise test takers to thoroughly discuss potential 'grey areas' with the examiner beforehand, and to be authentic and honest throughout the process.

The article explores perceptions from various perspectives on the racial tensions and issues in the United States, and how they tie into the history of the nation. The author acknowledges that those residing in the US may see it as a logical conclusion given the occurrence of racially-charged events in America's past, and asks how Europeans interpret these issues. The author concludes that while improvements have been made to racial equality in the US, more progress is needed, and also emphasizes the importance of understanding the historical context and geographical advantages of the United States when discussing its wealth and power.
The article presents a discussion on voice training techniques, specifically one referred to as "ring".

Grad students, particularly on PhD tracks, are discussing the pressure to attend social events as part of networking and departmental connection building. Some introverted students discuss struggling with the requirement, but others point out that these social events can lead to opportunities, departmental support, job recommendations, and more knowledge of departmental happenings. Overall, they suggest that regular appearances are important for networking, though students don't have to attend every event and should not feel guilty for opting out occasionally.
The author of the text expresses skepticism on the credibility of NASA and doubts the agreements on space due to its information source being monopolized by a few entities, particularly NASA and Hollywood, which the author believes are dishonest. They question the validity of evidence provided by NASA, touching on subjects such as the authenticity of moon landings, existence of the Hubble telescope, apparent inconsistencies in the International Space Station's (ISS) appearance, and claims of the "Challenger" disaster being faked. The author concludes that we essentially know nothing about space, mocks the acceptance of space information as a form of "Space Religion," and expresses belief in the flat Earth theory.
At a dinner with his wife's new boss, he found his steak too undercooked to eat. In a bid to dispose of it unnoticed, he attempted to throw it out what he thought was an open window, only to find it was closed, leaving a mess on the glass.

The film Snyder displayed to studio executives in mid-2015 was his original cut, a three-hour version that was probably more suitable for dedicated fans than a general audience (GA). Snyder had limited oversight during the production process, resulting in a final product that lacked multiple action sequences throughout that would have appealed to a wider audience. The movie spent too much time on character-building and did not deliver a consistent level of action, which might have frustrated the GA expecting a more evenly distributed and entertaining plot.

The speaker, on behalf of Albania, discusses the Albanian government's commitment to uphold human rights, fight against poverty and crime, and promote maintaining higher standards of respect for human rights.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a speech on the House floor supporting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021. In her remarks, Pelosi outlined the importance of the bill, which serves as a step toward ending systematic racism in the US and to curtail police violence, especially towards vulnerable and marginalized communities. Pelosi urged for a strong bipartisan vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, highlighting that while the legislation would not erase centuries of systemic racism nor bring back lives lost, it was a crucial move toward establishing a healthier and more respectful relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the issues that the global community, and the UN itself, face. Themes such as ongoing and increasing conflict, terrorism's spread, the escalating risk of a fresh arms race and the potential of a new form of Cold War are discussed, along with "violent extremism," the "root causes" of assault and potential nuclear warfare, with the idea of 'diplomacy for peace' promoted as a solution. He also highlighted the need for investment in universal cooperation, sustainable economic structures, the respect for international law, multipolarity and multilateral institutions to avoid a critical divide occurring between the world's two largest economies.

However, the impeachment process and proceedings carried forward by the House, as well as their decision, was deemed as necessary to uphold the Constitution and the laws of America as several senators did not follow their oath as impartial representatives for justice.

The speaker addresses the nation's economic struggles, specifically citing "the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history." They identify the government as the problem and argue for self-rule rather than elite management, emphasizing individual liberty as a fundamental American principle.

He targeted Mexico in particular, stating it is not a friend of the US, beating the US economically and sending its "people that have lots of problems" to America. In his critique of other political candidates, Trump said they didn't know how to solve issues domestically or internationally, and questioned how they could tackle ISIS.

The Texas War for Independence broke out due to various cultural, legal, and economic clashes between American settlers and the Mexican government. Major points of contention included the prohibition of public practice of religions other than Catholicism, the Mexican legal system's structure including its handling of slavery, and the limited Texan representation in the state legislature. The tension escalated into warfare, with key moments such as the fall of the Alamo Mission symbolizing the determination of the settlers and eventually leading to the establishment of an independent Texas.
The concept of beauty in Chinese traditional art significantly differs from Western notions of beauty, according to an examination of classical Chinese writings on art criticism. The study revealed that beauty (mei) does not hold a dominant presence in Chinese aesthetic categories, with greater prominence given to categories such as spiritual (shen) and subtle (miao), suggesting a shift of focus from the emphasis on aesthetic properties of the objects to the subjective experience involved in aesthetic appreciation. Furthermore, in contemporary art and aesthetics discourse, the question "what makes an artwork beautiful" has been replaced by "what makes an artwork meaningful or valuable," reflecting a significant shift in how artistic beauty is perceived and valued.
The atomic theory, which significantly explains the behavior of matter, was first conceptualized by Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus who imagined that all matter was comprised of small, indivisible particles called 'atomos'. However, it was English schoolteacher John Dalton who provided a more concrete hypothesis of atomic theory in 1807. In Dalton’s atomic theory, he proposed that all matter is made up of extremely small particles called atoms, each element consists of only one type of atom, atoms of different elements have distinct properties, compounds are made up of atoms from two or more elements combined in a specific ratio, and atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are rearranged.

In cognitive psychology, cognition is the term used to describe processes such as perception, knowledge, problem solving, judgment, language, and memory. The brain manages these processes, with concepts serving as categories or groupings of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as life experiences. In addition, the brain identifies prototypes, which are the best examples or representations of a concept, helping to organize and interpret information from the external environment and our emotions and memories.

The Americas were first populated around nine to fifteen thousand years ago by settlers who traversed the Beringia land bridge from Asia to North America, later travelling on to populate both North and South America. The Olmec civilization, which existed along the Gulf Coast of Mexico from 1200-400 BCE, is considered the bedrock of Mesoamerican cultures, developing major works of art, architecture, pottery, and sculpture, as well as breeding small domesticated dogs, growing maize, squash, beans, and tomatoes, constructing aqueducts, and developing a system of trade throughout Mesoamerica. The Maya civilization, flourishing from roughly 2000 BCE to 900 CE, continued the architectural, mathematical, and linguistic advancements of the Olmecs and constructed city-states and phenomena like El Castillo at Chichen Itza.
The Division of Labor is a principle that improves productivity by allocating specific tasks to workers based on their skills and specializations. These specializations allow workers to focus on parts of the production process where they hold an advantage, increasing the quality and efficiency of their work. In addition, businesses can harness economies of scale to decrease the average cost of producing each individual unit, ultimately enabling society to produce and consume much more than if every individual were to produce all of their own goods and services.
This article discusses the concepts of Ethnocentrism and Cultural Relativism. Ethnocentrism is the evaluative judgment of other cultures based on one's own cultural norms, often leading to the belief that one's own culture is superior to others.

The article emphasizes that when confronted with all the differences of a new culture, one may experience disorientation and frustration, which is referred to as culture shock.

Albert Einstein proposed that the presence of matter warps or curves spacetime, a concept that identifies this curving with gravity. His theory posits that when a beam of light or another object enters a region of distorted spacetime, its path will be different than it would have been in the absence of matter. This distortion in spacetime, in turn, depends on the mass of the material and how concentrated and compact it is, ultimately impacting how objects move through spacetime.
