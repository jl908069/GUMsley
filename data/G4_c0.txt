Researchers at the CNRS Lattice Lab and the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia in Spain have developed software that uses Natural Language Processing to automatically identify enjambment in Spanish. The software has been used to analyse approximately 3,750 sonnets by around 1,000 Spanish authors from the 15th to the 19th centuries. The study aims to stimulate novel analysis, and assess scholarly claims about the effects of enjambment, based on a larger and more diverse collection of examples than those typically provided by case studies of individual authors.
Epistemic pollution reduces people’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources, an article published in The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science said. It cites the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) as an example of such pollution, claiming that its conservative viewpoints on child health care presented as consensus views of all US pediatricians have deceived the public. It also points to the role of pharmaceutical companies and the publishing firm Elsevier in producing fake peer-reviewed journals to endorse commercial products, which has damaged the perceived legitimacy of all academic journals.
Research has suggested that learning a second language (L2) allows people to attain near-native levels of proficiency and understanding, which has in turn provided insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms that underpin language learning. However, maintaining this level of fluency over time can be a problem, with periods of no or limited exposure to the L2 language believed to cause a decrease in this proficiency. Further research needs to be done to determine whether this loss is due to factors including general maturation, cognitive development, or ongoing academic training.
A study from the Federal University of Santa Catarin suggests that using cognitive digital games can improve cognitive processes and attention in school children. The study involved 71 students aged seven to nine years old using a system called Escola do Cérebro on tablets in the classroom daily for a period of five weeks. The students' scores were measured on time, speed, stability, and accuracy and showed a significant improvement in sustained attention (p < 0.05).
A study published in the journal PLOS One suggests that the word 'huh' is universal among various languages. The research, which compared ten languages from five continents, showed that the similarities in form and function of the interjection, used to initiate repair when one has not clearly understood what was said, are greater than chance would suggest. The study also found that the form of the word was locally calibrated within different language systems and fulfilled the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding across all languages.
The study hypothesized that children over the age of six would have adult-like Scalar Implicature (SI) interpretations, but found there was non-adult-like performance with significant variability. It identified the need for more inclusive cross-linguistic studies and for additional training in distinguishing between felicity and truth value judgements. While limited, the study provides insights into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children, showing that pragmatic inference acquisition follows a previously identified order, but is completed at a later age in this language.
The National Library of the Netherlands and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam have collaborated to develop a set of digital humanities clinics for librarians, aimed at delivering basic methodological competencies and technical skills.

The project is intended as a proof-of-concept for the use of mutation operators in GIS and the authors intend to extend the approach to other domains.
Replication studies, which are meant to reproduce the results of scientific research, are critical in every field, including second language (L2) research. However, the L2 field, and academia as a whole, is facing a crisis characterized by a lack of sufficient published replication studies, poor quality of replication research and lack of reproducibility, which raises concerns about the validity and reliability of research. The study aims to address these issues, offering systematic and narrative reviews of the problems and providing recommendations to improve L2 replication research.
The article discusses various techniques for measuring ocean salinity, which is a critical parameter in marine observation, with many implications for physical circulations and biogeochemistry dynamics. Recently, satellites have been used to observe global sea surface salinity (SSS), providing a significant improvement in understanding ocean dynamics and climate change. However, the accuracy of these satellite-based measurements can be affected by numerous factors, such as sea surface and atmospheric effects, sea surface roughness, foam effects and radio frequency interference, requiring the development of precise retrieval models and corrections for these impacts.
A study found that adding artificial tails to chickens made them mimic the walk of dinosaurs. By adding the tails, the chickens' center of mass was moved backwards, making their bodies more upright, similar to bipedal dinosaurs. The study suggests that the walking style of ancient dinosaurs could be recreated in present-day birds.

Simon Ličen, an Assistant Professor at Washington State University, has said that the Paralympic movement in the US does not receive as much visibility as it does in countries such as Australia, the UK and Canada because it challenges the traditional conceptions of gender, ethnicity, and nationality. He believes the broadcasting of the 2014 Paralympic Games in the US will be a stepping stone for the movement, but it depends on how the coverage is handled.
LibriVox, a free online platform where volunteers record chapters of books in the public domain, was founded by Hugh McGuire who wanted to contribute to a vibrant public domain. McGuire started the project by inviting friends and podcasters to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent, and the site has since grown steadily with users able to record a chapter because they either didn't like the speaker or wished to offer another version of it. However, the site only offers public domain works to avoid complex copyright issues and as McGuire sees other sites, such as podiobooks.com, as being better suited to offering works under Creative Commons licenses.
Tina McKenzie, a former member of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, believes that regular international trips and competitions are vital to the team's performance.

McKenzie retired from the game after the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.
Frank Messina, known as the 'Mets Poet', has been writing poetry and performing spoken word since his teenage years. He sees the poet's ultimate success as moving a reader enough to receive their thanks. Messina has recently gained recognition for his Mets-inspired work, and notes the irony of his extensive body of work being overshadowed by it.
In a unique approach to producing content, satirical newspaper The Onion starts with a joke headline and then writes the article, according to an interview with President Sean Mills. The publication’s content is decided in a “brainstorm” with all 15 members of the editorial team, who read through a selection of between 600 and 800 headline ideas before deciding on around 100, which are then assigned to specific writers. The article is then drafted a number of times, while editors decide on what image will accompany the piece and make any final adjustments.
Shimon Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel, believes that there is a future to the peace process, but the problem lies in how long it will take and how many victims it will cost. According to Peres, the terrorists are protesting against modernity, which they view as a threat to their traditions, and the challenge is to help them understand that history is becoming more irrelevant and that they will have to adapt to the new age. He added that the new age is unprecedented and is completely focused on the future, and anyone dwelling in the past won't understand it because it is filled with prejudices and commitments.

He also talked about his writing, detailing how he began by writing down and interpreting his dreams, and how he believes there are many connections between mathematics and literature.
NASA’s Stardust space capsule, which collected samples from comet 81P/Wild (Wild 2) and returned to Earth on January 15, 2006, used a collaborative online review process to "discover" the microscopically small samples it collected. The project, known as Stardust @ home, was directed by Andrew Westphal and relied entirely on human intelligence to find the tiny interstellar dust particles within a huge collector. The project used a "Virtual Microscope" to enable volunteers to search for the tracks of the particles throughout the collector.
An all-girl Afghan team won a silver medal for "courageous achievement" at the inaugural FIRST Global Challenge Robot Olympics, held in Washington DC. The team, whose participation required intervention from Donald Trump after members were twice denied visas, used their robot to score points in a game that used blue and orange balls to represent water and pollution. The teens from Afghanistan, which is not covered by Trump's controversial Muslim travel ban, built their robot in two weeks after their supplies were delayed.
Fishermen and the Indonesian navy have rescued over 900 asylum seekers off the coast of Aceh, Indonesia. The asylum seekers, mainly Bangladeshis and Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority from Myanmar, have been turned away from Malaysia and Indonesia, a move criticised by both the United Nations and the United States. US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has contacted Thailand's foreign minister to ask the country to provide temporary housing for the Rohingya migrants.&nbsp;
A 14-year-old Texas pupil, who made headlines last week, having been removed from his school in handcuffs over suspicion that his self-made clock was a bomb, has since inspired a social movement. The incident sparked worldwide condemnation, with President Obama, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google all offering Mohamed their support. Following posts on social media and a trending hashtag campaign, the teenager is said to have received a VIP reception at the Google Science Fair in California, and plans to meet with international dignitaries at the UN in New York.

When the child was finally taken to the ER, she was malnourished and her skin was weeping; her corneas were also melting.
Microsoft is encouraging Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) users to upgrade their browse, stating that the 10-year old web tool has outlived its usefulness. In an aggressive campaign to shift users onto a newer version of Internet Explorer, Microsoft launched a website called "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown", stating that its goal is to decrease the number of IE6 users to less than 1%. The move comes amid increasing competition from rival browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, with Internet Explorer's market share slipping from 70% in 2009 to approximately 56% in 2011.
Valeska Paris, an Australian woman, claimed that she was imprisoned for twelve years on the Scientology-owned cruise ship, Freewinds, which she was initially sent to for two weeks at the age of eighteen. Paris says that she was forced to work in the engine room, had her passport taken away from her, and was forced to disconnect from her mother, who had spoken out against the Church after her ex-husband committed suicide following the loss of his fortune to Scientology. The Church has denied these allegations, asserting that Paris was not forced to be there or to work in the engine room, and that holding her passport was standard maritime procedure.
Almost half of all primary school children in Australia are mildly to moderately iodine deficient, which can lead to mental and growth retardation, according to a study published in the Medical Journal of Australia. This deficiency may be associated with changes in the dairy industry, where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers, resulting in a decline of iodine in milk, which has been a major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least 40 years. Authors of the report say iodine deficiency is "the sleeper health issue in Australia," and potentially a very serious one, calling for "urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia," in line with World Health Organisation recommendations.
North Korea's military has been put on a 'quasi-state of war' after recent exchanges of fire with South Korea; North Korea has reportedly threatened military action within 48 hours if South Korea does not cease broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda.

Italian religious schools are being hit with demands to pay property taxes and local services bills by local municipalities. The demands follow a July 8 ruling by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation, backing a demand from the Municipality of Livorno for religious schools in the area to pay property taxes. The concept is that since private schools charge a frequency fee they can be viewed as a commercial activity and thus should be subject to normal business tax.
The University of Southern Indiana Art Gallery is displaying an exhibit of Polaroids and screen prints by Andy Warhol as part of a major Warhol donor programme that has seen 189 other educational galleries and museums around the country receive items from the artist's photographic legacy. The programme has encouraged university art galleries to educate audiences about Warhol's art, particularly his photography, by donating over 28,000 Warhol photographs and other artefacts to these institutions since 2007. This exhibit, which displays Polaroids of well-known celebrities among others, runs until 9 March.
A study led by scientists from MIT and Colorado State University suggests that global warming and ozone pollution could reduce global crop yields by over 10% from 2000 levels by 2050, exacerbating food security issues. A variety of scenarios were considered due to the uncertainty over future levels of ozone pollution, and the effect on undernourishment by 2050 ranged from an increase of 27%-49%. The research found that in some regions, crop yields could be primarily affected by ozone pollution, indicating that an improvement in air quality could lead to better crop yields. 
A Greek court has ruled in favour of devotees of ancient Greek religions, allowing them to formally associate and worship at archaeological sites. Prior to this, the Greek Ministry of Culture had banned public worship at these sites. The ruling is controversial, with the Greek Orthodox Church, a Christian denomination, critical of worshippers of these ancient gods.
A Reddit thread has suggested that the cooking show Beat Bobby Flay might be rigged. The accuser claims that producers ask challenger chefs what they plan to cook, and only select those who offer dishes that are familiar to Flay or who offer "unique but irregular" versions of a dish. They also suggest that the producers prepare the judges for what they might eat, as judges often have specialities in the signature dish being made.
A technical support contractor was called out after hours to help a customer transfer "important data" from an old phone to a new one. The "important data" turned out to be the customer's Candy Crush progress, as the customer needed it to quit smoking and relax during work breaks. The contractor transferred the data via Facebook account and charged the client double for the after-hours callout.
The author relays an experience where a woman in a public restaurant openly shared her credit card details on a phone call, inadvertently giving people around her sensitive information. He also highlighted the often frustrating experience of customer service representatives trying to ensure data security when customers are casual or even resistant about maintaining their personal privacy. The author criticises companies that prioritize convenience over security, asserting that data breaches at huge corporations reveal a lack of prioritising security, rather than an inability to afford it.
Some internet users are speculating that the microphones in smartphones are being used to gather information for targeted advertising after noticing ads for products mentioned in their local vicinity. Many have noticed ads for items of conversation appearing on their Facebook feeds, despite not searching for them online. However, others argue that these occurrences are likely due to the range of digital data that can link a person's device to their workplace, and any purchases made there.
An Escape the Room employee shares two unusual experiences they've encountered at work. The first involves a young, intelligent boy whose parents underestimated and neglected his correct suggestions during the game. The second is about a persistent young boy who arranged a complicated 'Promposal' in the Escape Room, which was initially believed to be a marriage proposal.
Society should make reasonable assumptions about individuals' gender based on appearance, but be prepared to adjust if corrected, and respectful of non-binary genders, according to a detailed perspective piece. The article argues that while society upholds the majority rule of cisgender identity, it should also respect minority rights, and accommodate those whose gender identity does not align with traditional norms. The ultimate suggestion is that society needs to be educated and tolerant towards a variety of pronouns and genders.
Introverts on Reddit discuss their experiences with extroverts, who often assume introverted individuals have poor social skills and should try to be more extroverted. The introverts highlight the need to accept that dating and socializing will take effort and may tire them out, but can still be enjoyable and rewarding. They also point out that being introverted doesn't necessarily mean they lack social skills, and can still be charismatic and fun in social situations, but may need more time alone afterwards to recharge.
Countries borrow money by issuing bonds, which can be bought by domestic or international investors or other countries. If countries print more money to pay off their debts, they risk devaluing their existing currency and causing hyperinflation. The value of a country's currency is based on the trust in its government's stability and ability to pay back its debts, rather than being backed by gold or other tangible goods as it used to be.
The article theorizes that Monstropolis, the city from the Monsters Inc. movies, is the only city in the world, facing a massive energy crisis with Monsters, Inc. being the only company providing power. The evidence provided includes the fact that no other companies or cities are ever mentioned, all scarers come from two schools in the city, and when a human child accidentally enters the Monster World, it is said to be the first time in Monster History. The article also suggests that the monsters may be afraid of humans and the world outside Monstropolis, hence the city could be hidden from the human world.
Humans are the only species on earth consciously trying to limit reproduction. This action, however, is hard to prove or disprove with certainty. Humans prioritise the act due to the labour and resource intensiveness involved in raising offspring.
Polygraph or deception detection devices, although not admissible in criminal court, can still be useful tools for determining truthfulness during investigations. The machines work by detecting a person's fear response to particular questions, which can sometimes be misinterpreted as deceit. The device is not a definitive lie detector, but rather a tool for analysing physical responses and leading investigations.
The article discusses how Americans view racial issues in the U.S., the importance of understanding U.S. history to fully comprehend these issues, and solicits opinions from Europeans on the matter. The author suggests that while improvements have been made since the Civil Rights movement, racial issues continue to be prevalent and are a significant part of American society and politics. They also discuss the difficulty of applying U.S. racial concepts to Europe and admit to a limited understanding of the subject, despite considering themselves knowledgeable about U.S. history.

Some feel that attending these events is important for networking and future job opportunities, while others suggest it is fine to only attend major events. The general consensus appears to be that balance and calculated attendance at events which may offer professional opportunities are key.
The author of this post criticizes the credibility of space agencies like NASA and questions whether their findings can be trusted, alleging that these agencies have a history of deception. The author expresses skepticism about various aspects of space exploration, including the authenticity of the moon landing, the existence of the International Space Station, and even the roundness of the Earth. However, the author does not provide any solid evidence to substantiate their claims.
A man attempted to throw his undercooked steak out of a window during a dinner party at his wife's boss's house to avoid eating it, only to discover the window was closed. The steak smacked against the window and slowly slid down, leaving a trail of juice. Embarrassed, he then cleaned the window and ate the steak.
Stroke survivors have shared their experiences with recovery, noting that their internal monologues were simple and their consciousness was traumatically altered. They experienced difficulties in communicating, with some unable to speak properly, and others feeling they were participating in conversations, but later being told they weren't. Suggestions for aiding in recovery include being supportive, reading to the patient, and taking cues from speech therapists and doctors.
Zack Snyder presented a three-hour original cut of "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" to studio executives in mid-2015, but despite this offering meeting the director's own aspirations for the film, it was reportedly not what the studio envisaged. The studio may have wished Snyder had integrated more action sequences throughout the film rather than leaving the majority to a non-stop, action-packed third hour as it did. The film, using the "filmmaker-driven" approach, needed better planning from the start and could have benefited from a minimally-detailed blueprint to follow that suited the audience the film was targeting.
The Albanian Government and society are aiming for European integration, which involves strengthening democratic institutions and capacities of its central and local government to meet European Union standards. At the same time, the government considers the country's integration into NATO to be a major objective and aims to make its contribution to regional and global security. The government is committed to a full implementation of the standards enshrined in the United Nations and Council of Europe conventions, continuing to demonstrate its commitment to the protection of human rights, and continuing to submit reports to the committees of the six main United Nations human rights treaties.

On August 8, 1974, then-President Richard Nixon announced his decision to resign from the Presidency of the United States amidst the growing Watergate scandal. He stated that his decision was based on the reality that he no longer had sufficient political support in Congress to continue his term efficiently and effectively, and therefore the interests of the nation necessitated his resignation. Nixon concluded by expressing his hope that his decision would hasten the healing of the nation's division and bitterness, and fully endorsed Vice President Ford, who was to assume the presidency, as a capable leader.

In the early 19th century, American settlers migrated to Texas at the invitation of Mexico. However, cultural, religious, and systemic differences, along with the abolition of slavery in 1829, sparked tensions between the settlers and the Mexican government, leading to the formation of Texan separatist movements. In 1836, the settlers declared their independence from Mexico and established a new constitution, which eventually led to the Texas War for Independence.
The article discusses the difference between blinking and winking, stating that blinking is a universal biological function performed by humans to keep eyes hydrated and clear of debris, while winking is a cultural behavior, which is learned and can carry different meanings in social interactions, such as indicating a joke or flirtation. Renowned anthropologist Clifford Geertz used the example of winking to illustrate that while certain behaviors are innate and biological, others are learned, cultural, and passed down from one generation to another, a process called enculturation. The author concludes that most cultural behaviors are acquired unconsciously through happenstance, as a result of growing up in a particular society, and are shared among group members.
The Western notion of beauty as a dominant factor in art does not feature significantly in Chinese classical writings on art criticism, according to researcher Yanping Gao. Here, beauty, or 'mei', does not have a dominant presence, with only three or four of 24 aesthetic categories in classical Chinese poetry relating to beauty. Instead, other categories such as harmony, tranquillity, clarity, profundity, antiquity and subtlety are prioritised, and a comparison between beauty and the sublime, which influenced aesthetics in the West, is absent.
The atomic theory, first proposed by ancient Greeks Leucippus and Democritus, was later developed by English schoolteacher John Dalton in 1807. Dalton's atomic theory, which is still valid today, includes the following five postulates: matter is composed of small particles called atoms; an element consists of one type of atom; atoms of one element vary in properties from atoms of other elements; a compound is a combination of atoms of two or more elements; and atoms neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change. Dalton’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of macroscopic properties of matter, including the law of conservation of matter.
The article explores the human brain's cognitive processes, focusing on thoughts, problem-solving, judgement, memory and language. It delves into cognitive psychology, which studies how and why human thinking, emotion, creativity, language, and problem-solving interact. Additionally, it discusses the role of concepts and prototypes, the brain's ways of organizing information by categorizing received stimuli into cognitive structures.
Entrepreneurs in any industry are tasked with creatively finding new solutions to existing problems, often leading to disruptions within an established industry. An example is Airbnb, a disruptive technology that breaks away from the traditional model of the hotel industry by allowing individuals to offer their unused living space to others. This form of divergent thinking requires an entrepreneurial mindset that embraces innovation, creative problem-solving, and open-mindedness.
Philosophers Michael Ruse and Sharon Street both use evolutionary theory to argue against moral realism, the view that moral facts exist independently of what anyone thinks. Ruse argues that the apparent objectivity of moral judgments is an illusion created by our genes and that all aspects of morality can be explained without referencing moral facts. Meanwhile, Street contends that our moral judgments, influenced by evolutionary forces, have no relation to any supposed moral facts and therefore, cannot be deemed true. These arguments challenge moral realists to prove the existence and relevance of moral facts, and to resolve the discrepancy between these supposed facts and our evolution-influenced judgments.
The article explains different types of government, focusing on representative democracy and direct democracy. It provides examples of these systems, including the United States, which operates as a representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf, and ancient Athens, which functioned as a direct democracy, where citizens directly voted on proposed laws. The article also discusses other forms of government such as monarchy and oligarchy and offers examples of countries that have these systems, such as Saudi Arabia with an absolute monarchy and North Korea with a totalitarian regime.
The article discusses the importance of motivation, resilience, and grit in the learning process. It references a study conducted by psychologist Angela Duckworth, which found that perseverance and passion, or ‘grit’, were better predictors of academic success than talent or IQ. The article also provides suggestions on how to apply resilience and grit in learning, such as by viewing failed attempts as part of the learning process and constantly seeking different approaches to understand and retain new knowledge.
The first inhabitants of the Americas migrated from Asia via a land bridge called Beringia around nine to fifteen thousand years ago, eventually populating both North and South America and developing unique cultures. One of these cultures, the Olmec civilization, flourished in Mexico between 1200 and 400 BCE, creating significant works of art, architecture, pottery, and sculpture, as well as developing agriculture and a system of trade. After the Olmec, the Maya civilization developed in Mesoamerica, making significant architectural and mathematical contributions and perfecting the calendar and written language system started by the Olmec.
The division of labour and task specialization increases production efficiency, according to economist Adam Smith's observations. Smith notes that workers focusing on specific tasks where they have a comparative advantage heightens productivity, while businesses employing this principle often innovate faster, improve quality and can take advantage of economies of scale. Ultimately, this allows for society to produce and consume more than if each person had to produce all of their own goods and services.
Ethnocentrism, the belief that one’s own culture is superior to all others, can lead to disdain or misunderstanding of other cultures, and can cause conflict. On the other hand, cultural relativism is the practice of assessing a culture by its own standards rather than viewing it through the lens of one’s own culture, requires an open mind and a willingness to consider, and even adapt to, new values and norms. Both approaches can present challenges when aiming to understand or integrate with diverse cultures.
The article explains Einstein’s theory of spacetime and gravity. It describes how Einstein believed gravity to be the warping of spacetime by massive objects, an explanation differing from Newton's concept of gravitational force between two massive objects. The piece concludes with a practical example of how spacetime works using familiar objects like rubber sheets, grains of sand, pebbles, and paperweights to demonstrate how mass distorts space.
The article explains the concepts of quartiles and percentiles, which are measures of the location of data.
